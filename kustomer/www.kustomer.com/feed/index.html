										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14095 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1024x512_TW-3.jpg" alt="The Importance of Data Quality for AI Success in Customer Service" width="1024" height="512" /></p>
<p>If you have ever been drawn to the words “<a href="/ebooks/leverage-ai-for-customer-service/">artificial intelligence</a>” in a sales pitch or wondered if machine learning could improve your business, you might have also questioned if your use case is even a good fit for what a machine learning model can do. </p>
<p>A good way to approach answering this question is to consider the <strong>data</strong> you need to provide this artificially intelligent system in order for it to produce the promised result. That sounds like a reasonable exchange, except, are you sure you know what data means in this context?</p>
<h3>What is Data?</h3>
<p>Let’s say you are interested in a machine learning model that can predict the contact reason for inbound support emails (surprise: this is Kustomer IQ!). The model needs to see examples of previous support conversations and how they were labeled in order to learn what to do when new, unlabeled emails show up in the future. These examples are your data: a collection of paired inputs and outputs from which a machine learning model will extract patterns to make predictions. </p>
<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Importance-of-Data-Quality.jpg" alt="The Importance of Data Quality for AI Success in Customer Service" /></p>
<p>In this case, it’s up to you to determine the inputs (“Inbound Support Email”) and outputs (“Contact Reason”) and which input-output pairings best represent the predictions you want the model to make. And in general terms, the more data you expose the machine to, the smarter it gets. </p>
<p>Make sense? This is data. Without data, machine learning models can’t work. And a machine learning model will only learn from what’s in the training data: what doesn’t appear explicitly in the dataset will remain unknown to the system.</p>
<h3>Data Quality</h3>
<p>As we said before, the models extract patterns in order to apply outputs. You’ll notice in the above diagram, we did not tell the model how we were able to determine Contact Reason. We are just planning to show it input-output examples and trust it will eventually come up with a way to infer “Contact Reason” from an “Inbound Support Email”. This is where data quality becomes important: if we give the model poor quality data, the model will make bad patterns and ultimately incorrect predictions. </p>
<p>Poor quality data is noisy, conflicting, or perhaps consists of too few examples. In the diagram above, the last Inbound Support Email has been categorized as an “Exchange”. We already mentioned that it’s up to you to determine the output in the training dataset, so you or one of your agents decided the contact reason was an exchange. What if another agent decided the contact reason was “Return”? Technically, a return might need to happen for an exchange to occur, so the agent felt the return categorization made sense. Now, what if your agents made this mistake 50% or 25% of the time? This means your resulting training data does not reflect the truth of what you want the model to predict — sometimes the conversation is labeled as an “Exchange” and sometimes the same type of conversation is labeled as “Return”, but it should always be Exchange. In this case, the model will extract a pattern that might not consistently lead it to infer your preferred contact reason for future inbound support emails.  </p>
<p>This is an example of one of the main causes of poor quality data: unclear and conflicting boundaries between categories or topics. </p>
<p>Here are the characteristics your data needs to have to be considered “high quality” by <a href="/blog/what-kustomer-iq-can-do-for-you/">Kustomer IQ</a> standards: </p>
<ul>
<li>Heterogeneity (this is demonstrated in the scenario above): Clear and distinct topic boundaries between different tags and attributes</li>
<li>Stability: No big re-categorization changes 60-90 days prior to model training</li>
<li>Volume: Between 5,000 &#8211; 7,000 email conversations from the previous month, or about 500 conversations per topic</li>
</ul>
<h3>Recommendations for Creating High Quality Data for Kustomer IQ</h3>
<p>Kustomer IQ relies on machine learning models to predict customer contact reasons and suggest conversation shortcuts to agents. It’s important for you to have high quality data to make these models work as expected. </p>
<p>There are a number of steps you can take to ensure the highest quality of your data and leverage automation from the very beginning. Here are <a href="https://help.kustomer.com/en_us/best-practices-conversation-classification-r15sRLKqw">our recommendations</a>: </p>
<ul>
<li>Design tags and custom fields that best suit your needs. While it’s impossible to cover all cases, try to focus on the most important ones in terms of expected volume. For example, order status, returns &#038; refunds, or promo codes.</li>
<li>Create new tags to cover unlabelled information rather than redefining and remapping everything from scratch.</li>
<li>Add granularity in an incremental fashion. When possible, start with a broad category, such as pets, before attempting to split it into various, more specific categories, such as cats, dogs, or birds.</li>
<li>Try to use clearly defined tags and categories to organize your information. A good rule of thumb is to test them with people. If your team understands their boundaries correctly and knows when to apply them, a machine learning algorithm will be able to figure out their meanings.</li>
<li>Try to make your team work as consistently as possible. Again, this is easier to achieve when tag limits are clear. </li>
<li>Try to keep data stable for a while so that you can grow the amount of examples using your tags and custom fields. While you can iterate and re-define your tags and custom fields at any time, regularly changing this information will affect the amount of data points you get. Also, keep in mind that any re-definition of tags and categories will need the model to be re-trained.</li>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-14095 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/1024x512_TW-1.jpg" alt="Kustomer Receives ISO 27001 Certification for Information Security Management TW" width="1024" height="512" /></p>
<p>Consumer demands are at an all time high. According to Kustomer’s latest research, a whopping 90% of respondents think contacting customer service should be easier, and 85% of respondents think customer service should be faster.  Quick service also continues to outrank all other customer service qualities in terms of importance, no matter the demographic.</p>
<p>But in order to prepare for the future, brands need to consider how to deliver on these skyrocketing expectations. Luckily, our research also shows that preferences are beginning to shift across generations, with younger demographics preferring more <a href="/product/self-service/">self-service options</a>, and seeing the benefits of intelligent chatbots more clearly. Read on to learn what the data says about the need for CX speed and how self-service options can deliver. </p>
<h3>Self-Service Appeals to the Consumers of the Future</h3>
<p>An entire generation of consumers have grown up with the answer to any question in the palm of their hand. And after the pandemic, habits have shifted across all generations. Consumers that may not have shopped online previously, known how to book an appointment online, or had never been on a Zoom call, were forced to become digitally savvy overnight. What this translates to is a large cohort of the population that is willing, able, and even prefers to get questions answered on their own. </p>
<p>More than half of surveyed consumers (58%) reported that they prefer to solve <a href="/blog/customer-service-problems-solutions/">customer service issues</a> on their own versus talking to a company representative. Whether via an FAQ page or through a chatbot, talking to a human and dealing with the roadblocks that can often come with the process, seems to be falling more and more out of style. This only becomes more true when we break down the data by generation. When asked to rank the top three preferred customer service methods or channels, consumers under the age of 35 rank self-service amongst their top three. This means it will only become more important for businesses to invest in self-service tools as this generation ages, becoming the heads of the household and retaining their “help yourself” mentality. </p>
<h3>How Self-Service Can Deliver on the CX Need for Speed</h3>
<p>When businesses aren’t able to deliver fast service, their customers can become furious. And when we say fast, we mean immediate. According to our research, 72% of consumers expect their problems to be solved INSTANTLY upon contacting customer service. That means that <a href="/blog/wait-time-customer-experience/">wait times</a>, holds, transfers and searching for information simply won’t be tolerated. On top of that, the threshold where consumers start to experience frustration after contacting customer service — meaning the point at which that furiosity begins to take shape — is at the four minute mark. This threshold was seen across all customer service channels and all industries, meaning that the appetite for quick service is universal, and a speedy response should be consistent across channels and audiences. Additionally, 46% of respondents think businesses don’t respect their time, with that number growing to over half of consumers aged 55+, who may still prefer slower channels like phone.</p>
<p>The question becomes, how can you deliver on this need for speed? Businesses need to tap into technology tools and AI to eliminate the menial, repetitive, and time consuming tasks with intelligent automations that can detect intent, collect relevant information, automate agent interactions, and route conversations based on customer data or request type. Self-service options should always be available, and intelligent chatbots are now able to deliver contextual and personalized information that feels human, and can seamlessly hand off to agents when necessary. With the right technology, agents can focus on building relationships with customers and fixing complex issues in a timely manner. </p>

<p>In this episode of the Customer Service Secrets Podcast, Gabe Larsen flies solo as he recounts an interesting leadership phone call, during which he realizes what tools businesses need to be customer focused. He spills the secrets to success you don’t want to miss out on. Listen to the full podcast to learn more!</p>
<h3>The Phone Call That Created Change</h3>
<p>You know that deeply awkward and cringe-worthy embarrassment you feel for someone who’s being chewed out by another person and there’s nothing you can really do about it? Your demeanor in that moment might be calm but on the inside, alarm bells are going off and your brain’s screaming, “CODE RED! Get out of here!” Well, that’s exactly what Gabe Larsen experienced on a life changing phone call. During this call with leadership at another company, the Operations manager was being uncomfortably rude to the CX leaders and he could tell that compassion had essentially ‘left the chat’ at that point. This phone call led Gabe to realize what needs to change in the CX sphere and how departments can work together internally to become a customer-centric brand. </p>
<h3>Tip #1 &#8211; Kindness For The Win</h3>
<p>Gabe’s first tip to success is showing kindness to people across all departments in the company. When employees are rude to each other, it really slows down productivity and contradicts the company’s culture. This phone call made Gabe realize just how important each department of a company is to the success of the business. The CX team can’t function without the <a href="/blog/podcast-how-operations-transform-cx/">Operations team</a> and vice versa. To harbor a culture of kindness, Gabe reminds listeners that everyone at the company, no matter the department, is ultimately working toward the same goal &#8211; making the customers happy and looking toward a better future.</p>
<p>“I realize that sometimes CX leaders probably appear at times to speak a different language than you do…I promise you that they are trying the best they can and they want to partner with you to drive growth for the company.”</p>
<p>Leaders would do well to keep in mind that one team cannot properly function without the help of another team, just as Operations and CX are both key pieces to <a href="/blog/achieve-growth-with-customer-satisfaction/">customer satisfaction</a>.</p>
<h3>Tip #2 &#8211; It Takes Introspection for Expansion</h3>
<p>The next tip Gabe learns from the call is that growth happens when leaders turn their gazes inwards and do some self reflection. Of course no one likes to recognize their own faults, but it’s important for us to do so when we’re looking to grow as human beings. The same can be said for leaders looking to expand their reach and further cement their team’s role in the company. </p>
<p>The first thing leaders should analyze, according to Gabe, is their systems and technologies before starting to criticize their employees. “You can have great people, but man, you don’t have the right process system in place, you won’t win.” People definitely play a massive role in customer success, but if you don’t have the right tools in place beforehand, how can agents make the customer happy? Finding the right interface that consolidates all of the necessary information onto one screen is a sure fire way to make <a href="/blog/podcast-drive-customer-experience-with-employee-experience/">agents more efficient and happy</a> in their roles. </p>

<p>Bringing Departments Together in Harmony with Gabe Larsen</p>
<p>TRANSCRIPT<br />
Intro Voice: (00:04)<br />
You&#8217;re listening to the Customer Service Secrets Podcast by Kustomer.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (00:11)<br />
Welcome everybody to the Customer Service Secrets Podcast. You got your host, Gabe Larsen today. Today I am flying solo. One of the first read casts I&#8217;ve done, maybe ever, oh my goodness. Shame on me, but wanted to share with you an interesting experience that I had this past week. And hopefully, the experience helped me. I&#8217;m hoping that it will ultimately help you. So I was on a call, an external call. This is not internal to Kustomer and I won&#8217;t use any names. But there was a couple of lessons learned that I thought might be valuable to share. We were working with an organization that was going through what they wanted to be a customer transformation project. They are growing at scale in the direct to consumer space, a great product. And ultimately are feeling the pains on the customer experience side. And a couple of things happened that was kind of interesting.</p>
<input class="content-more-checkbox" type="checkbox" id="show-content-after"><label class="content-more-label btn small-btn secondary-btn" for="show-content-after"><span class="content-more-show-text">Read More</span><span class="content-more-hide-text">Hide</span></label>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (01:15)<br />
Number one was I, and maybe I&#8217;ll start like this. I want to ask a favor, I want to ask a favor to all operations professionals out there. If you don&#8217;t mind me saying, please, please try to be nice to your CX and CS leaders. During this conversation that I referenced previously, the ops manager was, might be a little strong, but borderline, verbally abusive. I know that&#8217;s maybe too&#8230; It was inappropriate. It felt awkward for all of us and I wasn&#8217;t even with the company, but the exchange between that ops manager and the customer service leader was disappointing. And I hate to see that happen as I believe both people want the best for the company. Now look at ops leaders. I realized that CX leaders don&#8217;t understand all the systems like you do and sometimes think that the latest technology will solve all their problems. I realize that CX leaders probably realize the difficulty of connecting all the systems in the CX tech stack.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (02:46)<br />
I realize that sometimes CX leaders probably appear at times to speak a different language than you do. But with all of that said, I promise you that they are trying the best they can, and they want to partner with you to drive growth for the company. So maybe, just maybe try and be a little bit nicer in your next conversation. Now I&#8217;m not saying that it doesn&#8217;t go for the other side in this particular instance. I don&#8217;t know the history of it, but in this particular instance, it seemed like the ops leader was being pretty rough, but I&#8217;d give the same words of warning to customer service leaders. Sometimes ops leaders may not speak the same language, but I promise you they want to achieve the same goals. So give them the benefit of the doubt.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (03:36)<br />
In addition, I&#8217;ve had conversations, that was point one. And I think it&#8217;s something we all need to remember. I mean, we cannot be successful as customer service leaders, as customer experience leaders, without the technology and operations team. And whether that&#8217;s finding a common language or partnering, we just have to find a way. They can&#8217;t be successful with us and we can&#8217;t be successful with them. So finding a way to create that common dialogue and reach a common goal is just so important. So that was point number one.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (04:06)<br />
Now point number two, was the structure and the process that we experienced in talking to this company. And I wanted to just pick that because I think so many of us are experiencing some of these pains and it&#8217;s just no wonder we&#8217;re having a difficult time delivering the experience that we and our customers expect.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (04:29)<br />
And I wanted to highlight just some of these, you won&#8217;t be able to visualize this and I did actually, someone handed me kind of a customer journey map, but I&#8217;m going to walk you through some of the challenges that this team was facing in delivering the customer experience. So hopefully you can at least visualize some things I talked about. So imagine a customer, that customer can reach out typically via email, but there is a chat functionality and phone. So it&#8217;s kind of a three channel approach. Most of the time it&#8217;s email and agents would go into a shared inbox and they typically would flag different tickets for customer service inquiries that they wanted to inquire about or potentially solve. These are mostly about orders, about a physical product item. In order to understand that particular item, this is where the daisy chain of complexity really started.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (05:24)<br />
The shared inbox isn&#8217;t great. I think we all know that. We&#8217;ve experienced that if you&#8217;re a smaller company. It&#8217;s just the way I think most of us go out and it does create agent collisions and this company had it. One agent comes in, flags an email, then a phone call comes in, goes to a different agent. Agent collision happens, different customer results. Agents fight, you know the spiel there. But in this particular instance, an agent would flag an email and then try to see if they could figure out what was going on with that order. And this is where I felt the frustration going on. So there were mainly three systems that they were really playing with. And then there were two different teams that they were interacting with. So they would typically start with NetSuite and there, they would review the customer history in the order.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (06:11)<br />
If the order was already sent, they would typically interact with this fulfillment team and see if they could pull it back in. If it wasn&#8217;t already sent, they could then in that suite, potentially find some of the information they needed. If they actually needed to understand a refund or potentially lock in a refund, they would have to take the PO information that was only in NetSuite and bring it over into Shopify. And then in Shopify, they could understand what type of refund was possible, what was actually happening on the order history. And then they could bring that information manually back into NetSuite with notes and kind of use the different notes field. Ultimately, if something was going to happen, they would, meaning like they needed to refund something or they needed to get something out, they would go into a system called Return Rabbit. And that&#8217;s where all the return processes took place and happened. Ultimately without information, they would go back into the email, respond to the customer, mark it done, categorize it away and be done. The poor agents depend on email. If it&#8217;s an email ticket, and I watched an agent do this. Yeah. It took a long time. Kind of a, and the biggest thing is, I don&#8217;t know how this scales. I mean, I talked to multiple people and I&#8217;m just like, wait a minute. So Netflix has, Netflix, excuse me. NetSuite has this, I was just watching Netflix, NetSuite has this and okay and then you go into Shopify and then you use notes and then the notes are kind of what we carry across the different things.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (08:07)<br />
And then we go to Return Rabbit and then Return Rabbit puts us back into NetSuite. And then you go here and I&#8217;m just like, is this documented? Because I can&#8217;t follow this. My heart just went out for the agents. It just went out for the agents. The people who are trying to deliver great customer experience and it&#8217;s like, we&#8217;re not making it very easy for them to do that. But also in addition to that, this is back to that point that I brought up earlier, the conversation between the CX leader and the ops person, this is not a problem that can be solved just by an ops person. This cannot just be solved by a CX person. You really need the combination to come together and see if they can map this out in a way that doesn&#8217;t feel so disjointed. So we talked about a couple of key problems here.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (09:03)<br />
One is ultimately, it&#8217;s just kind of a Frankenstack, to have this many systems all play small roles is something that&#8217;s just not going to be scalable for an organization. And then maybe an obvious point, but finding an ability to bring that into one system so that an agent can do everything in one screen, there&#8217;s got to be a goal to really deliver that personalized experience. Like I said, it kind of worked out on email, but if a phone call came in and they had to run that daisy chain of activities, it didn&#8217;t work quite as well. So one point was just this, too many systems. With too many systems though, too much siloed data. Part of it is here, part of it there and part of it over here. How can we, you may need all those systems.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (10:01)<br />
Sometimes you don&#8217;t. Sometimes you can consolidate, but oftentimes you do potentially need those systems, but making it easy for the agent, with a system to interface with that, then the data then flows from all those different systems into that can really be a huge differentiator to really drive that customer experience. Because you saw that as you saw that phone call, come in, person doesn&#8217;t know anything about them. And then they try to go find something about them and it takes a while. You could just see that time ticking and ultimately the customer experience and customer engagement, I think, dropping down. So how do you do that? How do you bring together an interface for an agent that is centralized and consolidated? That&#8217;s scalable, that&#8217;s certainly data-driven and supports all of those different channels? And I think that&#8217;s the challenge that presents itself to the modern customer experience that these companies who really want to differentiate themselves are faced with. Hopefully that paints a little bit of a picture.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (11:06)<br />
Some people say, &#8220;Hey, why is it so hard? I mean, why is it so hard personally, but why is it so hard to deliver a great customer experience?&#8221; I mean, don&#8217;t people want to do that? I mean, don&#8217;t agents want to do it? Don&#8217;t companies want to do that? Yes they do. But the Frankenstack doesn&#8217;t allow them to do it and it&#8217;s a task, but that realization is not often in the people, you&#8217;ve got to start with the process and the systems, and then you have the people. You can have great people, but man, you don&#8217;t have the right process system in place, you won&#8217;t win it. So I thought it was an interesting conversation that I thought I&#8217;d share a little bit with you and summarize with this.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (11:53)<br />
Number one. As I said before, this is a goal, a great customer experience that I think operations and CX have. So please give each other the benefit of the doubt. Number two, you have to understand that current state and the mess that you may, maybe not, you may not be here, but many of us are. You have to understand the current state of where you are, that Frankenstack, some of the challenges, the process, the data integrity, the siloed information, the disparate information, the routing, the shared inbox and the challenge that comes with agent collision. If you can wrap your head around that, then you can project. Then you can sit down with that partner, not an enemy, but a partner. And you can start to visualize a future state that puts the customer at the center. Not your problems at the center, not your systems at the center, but your customer at the center. And then the systems become a place to enable that, something that becomes scalable. So that as you add more agents, you can ultimately deliver that customer experience across the globe, across industries, across whatever that big growth trajectory may be for you. So that&#8217;s all I have today. Always fun catching up and with that, have a fantastic day.</p>

<p>Buyer expectations are higher than ever, and providing fast, effortless, and personalized support is no longer an advantage — it’s a necessity. According to research by PwC, 73% of consumers consider customer experience an important factor in purchasing decisions. Yet, only 49% believe companies provide a good customer experience, and one in three (32%) will walk away from a brand they love after just one negative experience.</p>
<p>With the increased pressure to maximize speed and efficiency and deliver seamless self-service, CX organizations will need to empower their agents with better tools and processes. In the future, agents will go beyond providing support — they will assume a new role as trusted consultants who drive satisfaction, long-term loyalty and revenue, by building relationships and delivering radically personal support.</p>
<p>Today, we’re excited to introduce two new features: Dedicated Agent and Live Mode, that help brands thrive in this new CX landscape. Available for both Enterprise and Ultimate plans, these features add transparency into support operations while enabling hyper-personalized support.</p>
<h3>Dedicated Agent</h3>
<p>The Kustomer platform is built on the premise of providing agents with as much context as possible to support them through their handling of customer inquiries, all with the goal of increasing the likelihood that those inquiries are handled efficiently and effectively. Half of that battle is getting the right agent matched with the right customer at the right time. Queues and Routing was the first step in this matching process, but what if an organization wanted to take this a step further and do their best to match a particular customer with the same agent every time they reach out to your team? This level of white-glove service is where Dedicated Agent comes in.</p>
<p>Through the function of explicitly linking a customer and agent, we believe that Dedicated Agent has the power to strengthen the relationships you’re trying to build with your customers. By routing customers to the same agent on every inquiry, agents can establish continuity in care and the type of consultative support that truly feels like an ongoing dialogue with your business, boosting satisfaction and loyalty as a result.</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<p>Dedicated Agent sits in front of your Queues and Routing configuration and acts as the first gateway when determining where to send an inbound conversation. Before we begin evaluating against your Queue rule criteria, we’ll first check to see if the customer requesting support has a dedicated agent. If they do, we’ll then check to see the status of that dedicated agent, who will fall into one of the three buckets outlined below. The first two are straightforward, while the third has some additional configuration to ensure it best suits your business’ needs.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the dedicated agent is online with capacity: The dedicated agent is routed the conversation.</li>
<li>If the dedicated agent is offline: The conversation continues down the standard routing path and routes to the next available agent.</li>
<li>If the dedicated agent is online but without capacity: This is where things get a little bit more interesting.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we know there are benefits to metrics like handle time, resolution time, and satisfaction when routing all of a customer’s inquiries to the same agent, there are also risks on the agent and customer side that we wanted to account for. For agents, we did not want to ignore capacity and force assignment or these interactions as they could quickly overwhelm an agent and degrade the support experience. For customers, we know that there is likely only a certain amount of time that they’d be willing to wait for their dedicated agent to become available.</p>
<p>To solve for these, we’ve added what we call Reroute Timers. These per-channel configurations determine how long (from 5 seconds up to 60 minutes) a conversation should await capacity from the dedicated agent.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-17915" src="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image2-1.png" alt="Dedicated Agent" width="600" height="485" srcset="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image2-1.png 1754w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image2-1-300x243.png 300w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image2-1-1024x828.png 1024w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image2-1-768x621.png 768w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image2-1-1536x1242.png 1536w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image2-1-1200x970.png 1200w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image2-1-293x237.png 293w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></p>
<p>So, when a dedicated agent doesn’t have capacity, the conversation will sit in a holding pen of sorts, waiting for the agent to gain capacity, for the duration of the reroute timer.</p>
<ul>
<li>If capacity opens, we’ll route to the dedicated agent.</li>
<li>If the reroute timer expires, the conversation will fall back to standard Queues and Routing rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Setting Dedicated Agent up is incredibly simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dedicated Agent can be activated from the General tab in the Queues and Routing settings page.</li>
<li>There you’ll find the configuration for your per-channel reroute timers. These values, from 5 seconds to 60 minutes, determine how long to wait for capacity from an online dedicated agent before falling back to normal routing rules.</li>
<li>Once the feature is enabled, the Dedicated Agent field will populate in the edit customer modal and can be added to insights panel views.</li>
<li>Users with the appropriate permissions can edit this field to choose which team member they want to set as the dedicated agent for this customer.</li>
</ul>
<p>This addition to your routing configuration gives you the power to encourage an intimate, high quality support experience even as you dramatically scale your support center.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Live Mode</h3>
<p>Adaptability — adjusting on the fly to meet your customers where they are or in service of improving one of your KPI’s — is a hallmark of a successful support center. In order to truly be adaptable, an organization needs to keep their finger on the pulse of both individual interactions as well as macro-level changes that happen throughout their workday.</p>
<p>As the last year forced many of us to pivot to remote or hybrid workforce models, we knew it would become important to provide our customers with new ways to monitor what was happening across their support center in real-time. No longer could we intuit that the phone volume was up based on the increased volume of all of our team members in the room around us.</p>
<p>We’re excited to introduce Live Mode for Custom Reports. This allows you to convert any custom report into a full-screen dashboard that refreshes its data every 30 seconds. You can now set up monitoring on inbound volume by queue so that you can make adjustments on the fly to ensure as short a wait time as possible for your customers. Or, add a chart that tracks messages sent per user per hour, to understand how each team member is contributing to the team’s goals.</p>
<p>Live Mode can be accessed by clicking on the Live Mode button in the header of any custom report.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-17912" src="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image1.gif" alt="Live Mode" width="800" height="500" /></p>
<p>Upon entering Live Mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your date range will be updated to Current Day &#8211; so midnight to 11:59pm in your timezone.</li>
<li>All histogram charts will have their intervals overridden to hourly.</li>
<li>We’ll hide the majority of the user interface to maximize the space dedicated to your charts.</li>
<li>Data will refresh automatically every 30 seconds (you’ll see the timestamp update underneath your report name).</li>
</ul>
<p>Other notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data refreshes will pause when you move to a different tab within the same window but will continue in an unfocused window — so running a dashboard on an external monitor is a-ok.</li>
<li>We’ve added an interval picker as seen on all of our Standard Report charts so that you can get the granularity you’re looking for from hourly all the way down to per minute.</li>
<li>We also offer the ability to quickly swap from today to past hour for high volume organizations that want to focus on micro-trends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expectations in the support center space are only going up from here. The support center of the future (and frankly, the present) needs to be nimble and staffed with empathetic and resourceful agents to succeed. We believe that Dedicated Agent will allow your team members to focus on what they’re best at, building relationships with your customers by providing meaningful, efficient resolutions that take advantage of their expertise. And with Live Mode, monitoring intra-day trends and making adjustments on the go has never been easier.</p>
<p>We’re looking forward to seeing how you leverage these tools to take your team’s performance to the next level.</p>

<p>The nature of the customer experience within e-commerce has never been more vital to the life of a brand than it is at this moment. While e-commerce (buying over the internet) has been growing in leaps and bounds before the pandemic, online shopping quite simply exploded in 2020. In August and September, <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/article/ecommerce-platforms/">Digital Commerce 360</a> asked 100 e-commerce executives what their budgetary priorities were for the coming year and 51% reported back that e-commerce platforms were at the top of their list. So while research showed that prior to 2020, 15% of Americans purchased products online <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/12/19/online-shopping-and-purchasing-preferences/">at least once a week</a>, and 28% shopped online a few times a month, that number has expanded exponentially with the onset of the pandemic and doesn’t appear to be slowing.</p>
<p>At the close of 2020, e-commerce sales accounted for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/19/e-commerce-surged-during-covid-groceries-sporting-goods-top-gainers-.html">14%</a> of all US sales. And while 2020 was a year that had very specific limitations, the e-commerce landscape continues to grow and thrive. At the forefront of this growth and expansion is the customer experience. With a world of options, the ability exists to forge bonds with a brand and cultivate ongoing, consistent consumer loyalty. Successful customer interactions translate to yielding higher profits, and position a brand to enjoy success in the long term. E-Commerce customer service trends tell us that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakemorgan/2019/09/24/50-stats-that-prove-the-value-of-customer-experience/?sh=764baf9e4ef2">consumers value their experience over goods and services they receive</a>. They expect highly personalized interactions which demonstrates the importance of actual connection over generic, robotic responses.</p>
<h2>How Can You Make the E-Commerce Customer Experience Work</h2>
<p>There are several avenues that can not only improve the customer experience but also enhance brand visibility. From social media to return/exchange instructions, to clearly articulated warranties to shipping practices to software solutions to an empowered customer service team, these factors can all make a profound impact on the customer’s experience with your brand.</p>
<p>Leveraging a customer-centric, omnichannel approach for e-commerce retail is key to addressing service issues, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Not only is the omnichannel system not confined to typical business hours or time zones, it imparts a personalized experience each time the customer engages with a brand. Incorporating digital-first support strategies, like utilizing a chat widget, in-app messaging, and efficient email practices will ensure that assistance and resolution are just a click away. Helping consumers resolve issues quickly and reducing the need for direct communication vastly improves brand equity and customer loyalty.</p>
<p>When interaction beyond self-service support is necessary, an omnichannel approach also empowers your team members. An omnichannel strategy, versus multi-channel, links all customer touchpoints for a seamless rather than siloed and disjointed experience. Whether via live chat or phone, this strategy provides context for the service agent. For example, if a customer sends an email on a Sunday night, and then reaches out again via live chat on Tuesday, omnichannel support software can capture the history of communication, no matter tha channel, in a single view. When the agent reaches out, they have a full context to immediately address the customer issue in a personalized manner. An agent who is empowered with knowledge can deliver a positive brand image while going that extra distance on behalf of both the consumer and company.</p>
<p>No matter what stage your e-commerce business is in (<a href="https://www.kustomer.com/blog/scaling-customer-service/">whether starting or scaling</a>), it is important to set the foundation for success within your e-commerce customer service team.</p>
<h3>Working the System</h3>
<p>In addition to enhancing the e-commerce experience by establishing a comprehensive software system, there are other facets that will assist in supporting and bolstering overall customer experience. Refining and clarifying each step of every interaction, not just the product pages themselves and point of sale, will encourage and maintain those important customer impressions. Avoid hiding or minimizing information that will assist any customer in handling and resolving an issue, even if it is returning a product.</p>
<p>• Policy Information: Documentation gives your team a set protocol to refer to when they have questions, as well as seamless access to information needed to answer questions without delay.<br />
• Shipping &amp; Delivery Policies: Eliminate second-guessing with clear shipping updates and options as well as delivery notifications.<br />
• Exchanges &amp; Returns: Making the policies clear and understandable from the start of the shopping experience will foster customer trust and clarity in the event of a return or exchange.<br />
• Warranties: Providing detailed and accurate product information is key. This includes clearly defined specs and descriptions of each item as well as transparent warranty information.</p>
<p>Consumers value brands that are honest and transparent. More and more they are gravitating toward brands that stand for something, have a strong mission or ethos, and share similar values. Social media is a powerful way to engage your customers and share your business’ victories, social justice work, and even any brand challenges. This is certainly true of last year. The pandemic created all kinds of interruptions, delays, and shortages. Communicating challenges and delays via social media became an important facet of customer relations. Your customer will always appreciate transparency and knowing what’s going on, and why, will impact their impressions of the brand and buying experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kustomer.com/blog/5-tips-proactive-customer-service/">Proactive rather than reactive</a> support measures are optimal. Better to anticipate needs rather than be in the position of constantly reacting to complaints or issues.</p>
<h3>The E-Normal</h3>
<p>While we emerge from the limitations of Covid19, e-commerce shopping remains embedded in our new normal. It’s become part of our collective lifestyle rather than merely a novel or occasional shopping choice. It is critical that your customers receive quick, personal responses to their questions and issues in order to maintain customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-17890 size-full" src="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1024x512-26.jpg" alt="Top 5 Ways to Break Through the CX Noise With Better Brand Interactions TW" width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1024x512-26.jpg 1024w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1024x512-26-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1024x512-26-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/1024x512-26-436x218.jpg 436w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>You probably don’t need me to tell you that the pandemic has caused a dramatic shift in how we do business. But do you know just how dramatic a shift we’re talking about?</p>
<p>At the height of COVID-19, e-commerce saw <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/enterprise/the-future-of-ecommerce/omnichannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 years of growth</a> in just 90 days, with a whopping <a href="https://www.shopify.com/future-of-commerce/2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener">84% of consumers</a> moving their shopping online.</p>
<p>Brands are now actively expanding their global footprint, knowing that they can no longer rely on traditional marketing methods like advertising to grow. They need to deal with unprecedented challenges head on if they’re going to continue to effectively attract, interact with, and retain loyal customers.</p>
<p>And today, that means focusing on the interactions between brands and customers. We know that CX has become a <a href="https://www.shopify.ca/enterprise/the-future-of-ecommerce/brand-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top differentiator online</a>, and brands that invest in a better customer experience are seeing the greatest returns.</p>
<p>We can see the truth in this when we examine the automation success of Wave Financial. In just a year, <a href="https://info.ada.cx/case-study/wave" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wave saw a 5X return on investment</a> using a brand interactions platform to handle customer inquiry spikes and leverage conversational AI to strategically improve their CX.</p>
<p>I can say with confidence, a killer CX strategy is one that <a href="https://info.ada.cx/learning-centre/analyst-report/harmonize-brand-cx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">harmonizes brand interactions across the entire customer journey</a>. To win customers, you need to create the kind of meaningful connection people are craving in the post-COVID world by <a href="https://www.ada.cx/posts/empathy-at-the-core-of-hyper-personalized-brand-interactions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infusing every conversation with empathy and emotion</a>. And you need to do it at scale.</p>
<p>As customer behaviors change, <a href="https://www.kustomer.com/blog/master-modern-customer-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CX leaders would be wise to grow as well, with new standards of excellence</a> and a modern approach to CX.</p>
<p>How? With a powerful and intelligent AI platform that prioritizes better brand interactions. Now is the time to make the changes you need, in both technology and strategy, to meet and exceed customer expectations. Let’s explore how industry-leading brands are doing this.</p>
<h3>1. Embracing the hybrid model: Humans and robots are friends, not foes</h3>
<p>There’s often a misconception that CX automation replaces human jobs, and this has caused apprehension for CX leaders. Truth is, <a href="https://www.kustomer.com/blog/achieve-growth-with-customer-satisfaction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the more you integrate conversational AI into everyday business, the more comfortable your customers will become using this technology</a>.</p>
<p>That is to say, automation is meant to complement your CX effort — not replace it — by offering consumers a first line of support that allows them to swiftly solve problems, find products, and update their accounts. And when their inquiries require a human touch, conversational AI can provide a direct hand off to an agent, who is equipped with the context they need to deliver a standout customer experience.</p>
<p>The result is more fulfilled, less stressed agents and reps, more valuable conversations with customers, and data-backed improvements and optimization. Essentially, better brand interactions, which result in a much improved CX.</p>
<p>The proof is in the pudding. Shapermint’s automation-first strategy has resulted in a 50% increase of sales facilitated by live agents, making their engagement with customers that much more valuable.</p>
<p>And this is exactly what fast-growing companies need to scale, especially as more customers flock to their websites to make their most important purchases. This was certainly the case for product design platform, InVision.</p>
<p>When InVision’s growth outpaced their support efforts, their agents were inundated with tickets that required immediate attention. They needed a solution that would free up agents’ time by diverting and containing tickets without having to scale the support team.</p>
<p>Adding an automated brand interaction layer to the frontline of their CX was crucial to meeting and exceeding customer expectations. InVision’s conversational AI now empowers web visitors and customers to access their knowledge base in an intuitive chat window, answering common, repetitive queries and allowing agents to support more complex tickets. As a result, they are automating and <a href="https://www.ada.cx/learning-centre/case-study/invision" target="_blank" rel="noopener">containing 83% of brand interactions, deflecting anywhere between 600-700 tickets a week</a>.</p>
<h3>2. Leveraging automation = accurate and predictable results</h3>
<p>To get the most out of your brand interactions, you need AI that goes beyond human-to-system conversations. This is referred to as Natural Language Processing (NLP)—the ability to program computers to process and analyze natural language data.<br />
You want to look for a platform that uses Natural Language Understanding (NLU), a dimension of NLP that focuses on actually understanding human language by matching input text to a knowledge model. Together, NLP and NLU are foundational to creating exceptional conversational user experiences. So when a customer asks the conversational AI a question, it can accurately interpret the question and populate the chat with an answer drawn from the knowledge base.</p>
<p>Platforms that do this best integrate content from existing CMS systems right into the platform, and then, into the chat, giving customers immediate access to answers and recommendations.</p>
<p>The ability for AI to accurately predict and respond to customer intent — and enable inquiry containment and customer self-service — empowers your agents to develop deeper, revenue-driving relationships with customers. So was the case for Balsam Hill.</p>
<p>Balsam Hill’s automated brand interactions strategy allows customers to easily access the information they’re looking for—be it videos, FAQ articles, tutorial guides, and more—which decreased live chat volumes by 30%, and helped their agents provide a more careful and empathetic service.<br />
And what do I mean by “empathetic” service?</p>
<h3>3. Applying hyper-personalization by way of empathy</h3>
<p>Everyone wants to feel seen and cared about. And that’s never been truer than today. Customers now expect customized, tailored brand interactions, and <i>hyper personalization</i> is what will set you apart. Every interaction has to be consistent, true to your brand’s promise, and customer data-driven.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-17894" src="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image1.png" alt="" width="800" height="424" srcset="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image1.png 1000w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image1-300x159.png 300w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image1-768x407.png 768w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image1-436x231.png 436w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>To create lasting emotional connections, brands need to focus on unifying sales, marketing, product, and support teams by centralizing customer data and brand interactions in one place. If you’ve been wondering how to get a 360° view of each customer, this is the way to do it. Using customers’ unique history interacting with your brand, you can leverage data to personalize the entire customer journey, not just one section of it.</p>
<p>Take Indigo for example. In 2019, Indigo diversified its delivery network from a single nationwide carrier to eight carriers of both national and regional options. The expansion made it understandably difficult for them to get a timely, centralized view of delivery performance, and this required them to focus their efforts on improving the customer experience around order delivery.</p>
<p>Integrating their <a href="https://info.ada.cx/case-study/indigo-convey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choice brand interactions</a> platform with Convey, Indigo now provides ongoing notifications to customers as packages reach key points in their delivery journey, and customers can track packages in real-time, giving them to-the-minute visibility and reassurance and reducing the number of costly WISMO (“where is my order?”) inquiries to live customer service representatives.</p>
<p>For those of us who are laser-focused on CX, designing your brand interactions around what your customers are going through in the moment, is the shift customers are demanding. It’s the difference between considering what you want them to do versus what you can do for them — and the key is showing empathy.</p>
<p>If you want your customers to stick with you until the end, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2020/07/31/lead-with-empathy-to-enhance-customer-experience/?sh=4544ac477ada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use all the data that’s available to you</a> to personalize digital conversations in a way that’s actually meaningful. The goal is to make it all about the customer — not the company. And that requires an intelligent AI solution that makes it easy to show individual empathy on a grand scale.</p>
<p>By making more confident, data-backed decisions, you can improve conversion and exponentially impact the metrics that matter most. Kustomer’s VP of Growth says it best:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-17896" src="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image6.png" alt="" width="800" height="356" srcset="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image6.png 1999w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image6-300x134.png 300w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image6-1024x456.png 1024w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image6-768x342.png 768w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image6-1536x684.png 1536w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image6-1200x534.png 1200w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image6-436x194.png 436w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<h3>4. Anticipating customer needs and providing proactive CX</h3>
<p>When thinking about the shift to proactive brand interactions, I’m compelled to share one of my favourite quotes by Charles Darwin: “It is not the strongest of species that survives, nor the most intelligent. It is the one most adaptable to change.” Shifting your focus to how you can enhance each and every interaction your brand has with your customers is the essence of the opportunity in automation and conversational AI.</p>
<p>With a human-first approach, it’s logistically impossible to expect agents to have contextual data and customer information at their fingertips all at once and wait for the right trigger to manually send out a proactive message — especially at scale. With a digital-first, automation-first approach, you can. And this is an incredibly important point of differentiation.</p>
<p>With proactive CX, customers feel valued and that the brand has their best interests at heart — and that builds trust and loyalty, allowing you to hold on to customers for longer. Loyalty and retention are the keywords here, because that’s what will drive revenue.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-17897" src="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image5.png" alt="" width="800" height="397" srcset="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image5.png 946w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image5-300x149.png 300w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image5-768x382.png 768w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image5-436x217.png 436w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>And what’s a proactive brand interactions model’s best friend? Using customer data to take insightful action and anticipate your customer’s next move.</p>
<h3>5. Aligning ACX with business goals using a data-driven approach</h3>
<p>As you think about your own brand’s automated customer experience (ACX®) strategy, it’s important to understand exactly how automation is working to ladder up to bigger business goals, or as I like to call it, your North Star.</p>
<p>Arming your brand with a platform that can easily define success metrics, track them within a dashboard, and optimize according to the insights revealed is what will set your CX apart, and keep your company following it’s shining brand promise.</p>
<p>You not only need to define, track, and measure success, you need the freedom to experiment easily, iterate quickly, and optimize with agility. With this, you can confidently build and create more meaningful brand interactions at scale.</p>
<p>This means measuring custom goals like demos booked, leads captured, forms completed, and sales escalations, just to name a few.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-17898" src="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image2.png" alt="" width="800" height="379" srcset="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image2.png 1368w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image2-300x142.png 300w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image2-1024x485.png 1024w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image2-768x364.png 768w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image2-1200x568.png 1200w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image2-436x207.png 436w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>One thing I’ve learned is that you should never assume what people want, be that your closest friends, family members, and in this case, your customers. It is imperative that you take a step back to analyze what works and what doesn’t, your big wins and momentary setbacks, to enhance and optimize your next steps.</p>
<p>To set your brand apart from the competition, choose a platform that allows you to bid farewell to the guesswork. Your best bet is using the results of A/B testing to create multiple versions of an answer, flow or proactive campaign, show the variants to different segments of customers at the same time, and then measure and compare the performance of each variant.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-17899" src="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image4.png" alt="" width="800" height="355" srcset="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image4.png 1700w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image4-300x133.png 300w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image4-1024x454.png 1024w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image4-768x341.png 768w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image4-1536x681.png 1536w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image4-1200x532.png 1200w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image4-436x193.png 436w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></p>
<p>Your brand has a choice, meet your customers where they are or run the risk of falling behind. It’s my hope that you seize the day and transform the way you engage by investing in better brand interactions. Your customers will thank you for it.<a href="https://www.ada.cx/demo?hsCtaTracking=bcfbaf81-a02a-48e8-b87b-a8876ed5834a%7C1f441dcb-20de-4552-a93f-d0a05e8176a4"><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter wp-image-17900" src="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image3.png" alt="" width="800" height="356" srcset="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image3.png 1999w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image3-300x134.png 300w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image3-1024x456.png 1024w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image3-768x342.png 768w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image3-1536x684.png 1536w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image3-1200x534.png 1200w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/image3-436x194.png 436w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /></a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-9968 size-full" src="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BLG_078_1024x512-1.jpg" alt="Woman engages with customer service queries at home on laptop." width="1024" height="512" srcset="https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BLG_078_1024x512-1.jpg 1024w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BLG_078_1024x512-1-300x150.jpg 300w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BLG_078_1024x512-1-768x384.jpg 768w, https://www.kustomer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/BLG_078_1024x512-1-436x218.jpg 436w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></p>
<p>We live in an era where technology has revolutionized how people interact with each other, as well as how they purchase goods and services central to daily life.</p>
<p>In order to thrive, businesses must understand customer needs on a personal level. This can be achieved by keeping track of customer feedback, analyzing the feedback and using insights to anticipate what they will require in the future.</p>
<h3>What Is Voice of the Customer?</h3>
<p>Voice of the Customer (VoC) is the process for analyzing customer needs, and using them to inform your customer service strategy. Put simply, VoC is a process for listening to customers to create a better product or service and <a href="https://www.kustomer.com/ebooks/keys-to-delivering-modern-customer-experience/">customer experience</a>.</p>
<p>Data from customers can be used in a variety of ways to make business decisions better suited to your customer base. Understanding VoC can help you improve products, create new marketing strategies, uplevel your advertising, and even rebrand your company.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at the three steps that are part of the Voice of Customer process.</p>
<h4>1. Gather Feedback</h4>
<p>The first step to understanding what your customers are looking for is to gather data. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as through live chat, surveys, social media, and customer reviews.</p>
<p><strong>Live Chat</strong>: Live chat allows you to learn about your customer&#8217;s issues and questions in real-time. It provides an opportunity for 1:1 interactions which can be stored for later analysis with the right tools. Surveys can be sent at the end of each session to better understand the customer’s experience and satisfaction.</p>
<p><strong>Surveys</strong>: Speaking of surveys, they allow you to create target questions that help you understand the <a href="https://www.kustomer.com/guides/what-consumers-expect-from-the-customer-experience/">customer experience</a>. Survey questions should be clear and easy to understand, and kept to a reasonable length.</p>
<p><strong>Customer Reviews</strong>: Customer reviews are an extremely effective way to see what is working and what needs improvement within your business. Reviews help detail the customer experience and demonstrate the best and worst cases in your transaction history.</p>
<p><strong>Social Media</strong>: With so much time spent engaging with friends, family and media publications on social media, it’s logical that consumers expect to be able to interact with brands on their preferred platforms. Each platform’s analytics tools offer a wealth of data about your target consumers that can help inform their preferences. You can also use messaging features to respond to inquiries and <a href="https://www.kustomer.com/blog/how-to-handle-customer-complaints/">handle customer complaints</a>. And of course, social sentiment analysis lets you see what is being said about your business and its products.</p>
<h4>2. Analyze the Data</h4>
<p>Data is great, but it’s what you do with that data that really matters. According to <a href="https://www.sixsigma-institute.org/Six_Sigma_DMAIC_Process_Define_Phase_Capturing_Voice_Of_Customer_VOC.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Six Sigma Institute’s philosophy</a>, brands get more value out of understanding customers’ needs over wants, and optimizing their process and products to meet those needs. Analyzing feedback to understand what your customers really expect from your brand will help you determine where to focus your product and customer experience efforts.</p>
<h4>3. Take Action</h4>
<p>Armed with insights from customer interactions, you’re ready to initiate change. Say, for example, a customer cancels their hair-care product subscription, leaving the feedback that they were receiving too many bottles of shampoo. The customer’s feedback might indicate that they need more flexibility in how often they receive their product. Offering a less frequent shipping option could be the solution to keeping them, and many others, subscribed.</p>
<p>The Voice of Customer allows brands to better understand their customers as consumers and individuals. In a fast-paced world with high customer expectations, companies need to utilize VoC to understand customer needs and quickly adjust to those needs.</p>
<p>Kustomer continues to improve the way businesses handle customer service. <a href="https://www.kustomer.com/?_bt=378535195323&amp;_bk=kustomer&amp;_bm=p&amp;_bn=g&amp;_bg=82871962251&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw5uWGBhCTARIsAL70sLIR4frH5Oex3j8b_2HBcJGBS1pw7_u1NovdLotn8eC36HiPd7lCNuAaAraiEALw_wcB">Learn more</a> about our valuable and revolutionary software.</p>

<h5>Ada and Kustomer are joining forces to help you scale brilliant customer experiences through a winning combination of AI-powered automation and the human touch.</h5>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
Today, customers wield more power than ever before. To win customers’ loyalty, businesses need to deliver meaningful experiences on the channels customers prefer — anytime, anywhere. However, running 24/7 support is costly and challenging to scale. That’s why more and more businesses are turning to a hybrid model of support. This is because while chatbots are expected to <a href="https://www.cxtoday.com/contact-centre/what-is-a-chatbot/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">save businesses eight billion dollars by 2022 and can automate 80% of customer inquiries, 70% of customers still prefer to be connected with a live agent.</a></p>
<p>To power this hybrid support model Ada and Kustomer have joined forces to build an integration that empowers businesses to deliver contextualized, fast customer service, at scale. Businesses can configure Ada Glass, Ada’s chatbot solution, to automate routine tasks to free up your agents’ time. Define keyword triggers within Ada Glass to facilitate a seamless handoff to a live agent within Kustomer, complete with full conversation transcripts alongside customers’ information and previous conversation history, all within a comprehensive timeline view directly within Kustomer.</p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<h5>No-Code Platform for Speedy Deployment</h5>
<p>Ada’s no-code building tools and drag-and-drop interface give CX teams full control over their own bot-building to launch a smart chatbot in 30 days with no technical lift.</p>
<h5>Power Conversational AI for Automation at Scale</h5>
<p>Ada’s industry-leading natural language processing technology requires minimal training to detect customer intent, enabling fast-growing brands to scale more automated interactions without adding headcount.</p>
<h5>Scale One Bot Across Channels &amp; Languages</h5>
<p>Build automated flows in a single Ada bot that can be deployed across social channels and translated into 120+ languages. With Ada’s chatbot, it’s never been easier to amplify your social reach to customers and speak in their preferred language, all without a single line of code.</p>
<h5>View the Entire Customer Journey at a Glance</h5>
<p>Deliver personalized experiences at every touchpoint with a single thread of all customer interactions, including chat transcripts from Ada Glass, displayed in an actionable timeline view within Kustomer.</p>

<p>In this episode of the <em>Customer Service Secrets Podcast</em>, Gabe Larsen is joined by CEO and longtime customer advocate, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendisturgis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wendi Sturgis</a>. Wendi has years of experience in CX and in leadership positions and she shares some of the secrets for how to make your company stand out. Listen to the full podcast episode below to learn more.</p>
<h3>Winning Over the C-Suite</h3>
<p>How can a company really win if the C-Suite isn’t on board with the CX team? Truth be told, it can’t win in that case. Gaining the favor of members in the C-Suite is key to building a strong, customer-minded culture. When CX has the backing of the C-Suite, it creates a company culture that keeps the customer in mind through every business decision, no matter how big or small. One way leaders can win this backing is through sharing customer success stories with the higher ups, <a href="/blog/podcast-drive-business-value-with-cx/">which adds value to your CX team</a>’s efforts. “I cannot emphasize this enough, every opportunity you have as a leader in the internal communications, tell customer stories. Every single time.” Doing so can really transform the C-Suite into a customer-minded suite, further opening the door for internal collaborations and building a customer-centric brand. Aligning other departments like engineering, new products, sales, and finance with CX is also a great way to build customer advocacy when presenting to the C-Suite. When those board members see your passion as a CX leader for the customer and the brand as a whole, you’re more likely to get their approval.</p>
<h3>Being Culturally Sensitive for Global Success</h3>
<p>In an effort to keep up with <a href="/blog/master-modern-customer-experiences/">the modern customer</a>, many companies are considering going global but struggle to expand on such a broad scale. Wendi has a plethora of stories and great advice for companies making their mark across the globe but most importantly, she emphasizes that leaders need to be sensitive to the work cultures of other countries. For example, “In Germany, it’s illegal to ask workers to work on a Sunday. Saudi Arabia, you have to work on Sunday.” In their early expansion stages, Wendi notes that her American teams weren’t quite grasping cultural differences and it created a rift between brand and customer. To eliminate this problem, Wendi suggests hiring talent in other countries who understand the cultural norms and can help create a <a href="/blog/podcast-scale-global-cx-team/">seamless transition</a>, a solution that worked for her. </p>
<h3>Is the Customer in Your DNA?</h3>
<p>Intense as it may seem, Wendi believes that as a leader, the customer should be part of your DNA. They need to be at the forefront of every business decision and policy made within the company. For many CX leaders this can be daunting, especially when trying to manage so many different aspects of the company from winning the C-Suite to contributing to a customer culture. Wendi’s secret to success in this aspect is performing NPS every single month, which comes with many benefits. Not only does it give up to date scores for how customers view their interactions with the brand, but it also gives current and authentic feedback for new product launches. This is just another way you can be a hero for your customers. “You have to understand that you’ve got an incredible mouthpiece and a megaphone because we wake up every day being passionate about our customers.” Creating a customer-centric culture and keeping them in the company DNA is a sure way to have long term success.</p>

<p>Tomorrow’s Customer Experience Starts Here with Brad Birnbaum</p>
<p>TRANSCRIPT<br />
Intro Voice: (00:04)<br />
You&#8217;re listening to the Customer Service Secrets Podcast by Kustomer.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (00:11)<br />
Hi, welcome everybody. We&#8217;re excited to get going today. We&#8217;re going to be talking about CX transformation from a CEO perspective. Not every day, you get the CEO perspective and to do that, we brought on Wendi Sturgis, New York tech scene, for the last 25 years. Most recently, the CEO at Yext. Wendi, thanks so much for joining. How are you?</p>
<input class="content-more-checkbox" type="checkbox" id="show-content-after"><label class="content-more-label btn small-btn secondary-btn" for="show-content-after"><span class="content-more-show-text">Read More</span><span class="content-more-hide-text">Hide</span></label>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (00:32)<br />
I&#8217;m awesome. Yeah. I just don&#8217;t want to take Howard&#8217;s role away from him. So I was in Europe. So I can also bring an amazing global view, which we might even want to take a few minutes and talk about CX, how you think about a transformation globally, because there are differences.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (00:50)<br />
I think we got to do it. Let&#8217;s start with the big picture. I wanted to just hear, oftentimes, a big question on a CX leader&#8217;s mind, is how do they work best with their CEO or senior leadership? You&#8217;ve got CX people talking about NPS and the voice of the customer, CEOs talking about bottom and top line. What recommendations do you have for CX leaders really trying to work effectively with their senior leadership?</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (01:13)<br />
Yeah, and I mean, we have this conversation so much and I also was the Chief Customer Officer of Yext. I ran the support functions, all of the customer facing functions. So it gives me a unique perspective because I had to sell it, sell it to my board. And then also think about as a CEO of Europe, with the team that was reporting to me and these kinds of things they wanted to do. So listen, and this is a piece of advice that I have for everybody, whatever your functional area, the more you can get educated on how business works, I encourage people. I always ask people, what&#8217;s your source of getting business news? And they always kind of look at me and I say, I personally think you need to read the New York Times business section or the Wall Street Journal or CNBC.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (01:55)<br />
And I&#8217;m really surprised how many times people are like, &#8220;Well, I get up and I watch Good Morning America.&#8221; I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Well, that&#8217;s cool. But I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s going to help your career.&#8221; I mean, that&#8217;s what you need. And so why I bring that up, Gabe, is because you&#8217;ve got to position your CX into the bigger corporate lens of how a C-suite thinks. And I think if you don&#8217;t have the complete understanding, trying to understand business, and so I would say, I&#8217;m sure your company has annual process planning or like Salesforce, V2moms or whatever, it&#8217;s like anything and as we in sales have to do, we&#8217;ve got to attach and understand what are those key priorities for the company and that the CEO is committed to the board? And you&#8217;ve got to know those and if you can&#8217;t tell a story about how your CX initiatives are going to help that CEO and the C-suite deliver against those goals for the board, you&#8217;re already up against a huge battle, right?</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (02:51)<br />
It&#8217;s just 101. And I know that everyone probably knows it, but here&#8217;s where I think it gets different. By sitting down and asking and saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m now going to come back to you with not only this year&#8217;s roadmap, but let&#8217;s also look at the three year strategic plan.&#8221; So asking, what at my level, and again, we can all be at different levels in our CX, but what&#8217;s appropriate and asking your boss, you&#8217;re starting to transform yourself as an executive by asking that question. So that I know I can&#8217;t get everything that I want. I know that I can&#8217;t impact everything, but I&#8217;m going to want to have to do this year to support this year&#8217;s. But let me think strategically, and we&#8217;ll talk more about the roadmap also with your product work, but how you can put together a three-year plan. So I really think it&#8217;s key.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (03:35)<br />
I love that. It seems like yeah, we get into those conversations and we forget the big picture. We think more about ourselves than what the CEO wants. And I think that&#8217;s oftentimes where the disconnect. Now, you&#8217;re a CEO. You&#8217;ve played that role in multiple different instances. It does seem like there&#8217;s obviously a lot of distractions. You want to keep the customer first, but things get in your way. You sometimes lose focus. How have you been able to do it? How do you find a way to keep the customer at the center in those companies you&#8217;ve worked at? What advice would you give to others trying to do the same?</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (04:09)<br />
I think it starts with having your own kind of philosophy and mantra about it. And really, and what I say by that is knowing how you&#8217;re going to talk about the role of the customer in your company. And I&#8217;m going to tell a real quick story. But I actually think it&#8217;s worth it. And I want to spend the most time on this topic because I am really prepared and I have five very tangible recommendations for people.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (04:34)<br />
All right. Do it. Let&#8217;s do it.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (04:34)<br />
There&#8217;s a woman named Andy Cunningham and you and I actually were chatting before this and how you think about branding. And she&#8217;s very famous. You know you&#8217;re famous when you have an actor play you in a movie and she had an actor play her in the Steve Jobs movie. She was one of the key marketers, Gabe, for the 1984 Mackintosh. You just can&#8217;t get more famous in marketing.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (04:54)<br />
And so there, she and her company had this archetype for companies and the customer archetype is normally a caregiver culture. Okay. Yext is not a caregiver culture. Okay. And that&#8217;s fine. We are a product innovator culture, and that&#8217;s just who we are. But here&#8217;s what, and I say this story because I know it was successful, but she said, this is one of the only companies where the customer came through in all the interviews, even though we&#8217;re a product innovator archetype of a company. And everybody around the table, Gabe, pointed at me and said, it&#8217;s because of her. So I only say it because you might have to accept that your company has a different archetype. It could be a financially disciplined company. And if you&#8217;re interested, she has an amazing book called Getting to Aha! And you can read about all her archetypes.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (05:44)<br />
She&#8217;s really an amazing leader, but in most companies, there&#8217;s only one archetype of company. That&#8217;s a caregiver, that&#8217;s all about the customer, all of the others, there&#8217;s like 12 others. So you&#8217;ve got to understand the culture of your company and your role and how you&#8217;re going to do that because the probability is most of us work in companies that are, again, if you&#8217;ve got a one in 13 chance and I don&#8217;t even know what the percentages are. So we have to kind of accept that. Like even though I loved that archetype of innovator, it just, the customer wasn&#8217;t really a part of our DNA. So here&#8217;s the three things that I do.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (06:19)<br />
One, and I cannot emphasize this enough, every opportunity you have as a leader in internal communications, tell customer stories. Every single time. You have to, every time you get to talk to the newsletter or speak at a company event or at your boss&#8217; staff meeting, tell those stories.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (06:46)<br />
The second is, and I think many of us learn this from the Salesforce playbook. I was doing it and I understand it, that notion of customer advocacy, but you&#8217;ve got to tell, whether you&#8217;re dealing with millions of customers and you&#8217;re telling the story about how your product or your service changed their lives. The level of the story, it could be a $10 million relationship, or it could be an individual consumer that you touched with a hundred dollar transaction, but telling those stories, every chance you get internally and creating those customer champions. Again, it&#8217;s different in a B2B versus the B2C environment, but finding ways to do that both internally and externally. And I think many of us learn this from Salesforce and how they were so incredible in their customer advocacy. The other is, and I give Skipper, our HRO, credit for this, because when I first took over as the Chief Customer Officer, I&#8217;m embarrassed to say, Gabe, we weren&#8217;t doing NPS. Shame on us.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (07:43)<br />
And I had responsibility for CX too. And it was something I did. And I went to the C-suite, our weekly executive and I said, here&#8217;s how we&#8217;re going to do it. And I walked through everything, blah, blah, blah. This is the software we&#8217;re going to use. We&#8217;ll get to software and a little bit, and how automation is just important. And he said I learned this on Twitter. We were always on NPS. And I don&#8217;t meet that many companies who do it. I think you said, Yahoo, you do it once a year. You do it a quarter. We did it every month and it&#8217;s very easy to do, and you do it rolling. But what it does is it allows you to put NPS in front of the company and keep it top of mind because you&#8217;re doing it every month.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (08:23)<br />
And again, it wasn&#8217;t my idea. I always give credit again, when you get your other executives brought in, and this is my other piece of advice, which was a great segue. You know, my head of people is like, is he going to be involved with customers? You might not think it&#8217;s logical, but he did. And he had a great idea and we made a big deal about that. So figuring out across all your stakeholders, sales, and product and engineering, how you go to them and help them understand the voice of the customer and all of those things. So whether it&#8217;s a customer support issue, because customer support was a huge part of my work with my engineering team or your supply chain or your store operations in house if you&#8217;ve got a head of store ops, or your supply chain. Spending that time and investing, so you&#8217;re due to the C-suite, but that you&#8217;re also, and again, Skip was a great example. My chief HR officer.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (09:18)<br />
And then I think the last thing is really understanding that the culture part is so important with customers. We have a profile person, we just need them. We don&#8217;t care what they&#8217;ve done before. I can tell an amazing story about a bright young man that we hired, who has a lot of ivy league kids. This can happen. Individual young man happened to go to Princeton, where we have a lot of people and he was deeply, eminently unqualified for the job, Gabe. I mean, I&#8217;d tell you, I was like, this guy has been working in credit risk, like at some huge bank and he just didn&#8217;t have the background. He didn&#8217;t and my friend said, &#8220;Please meet with him.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (09:59)<br />
And I met him and I said, &#8220;He fits our culture. Our customers are going to love him.&#8221; He became one of the singular greatest rockstars in the company. He was unbelievable. And obviously we knew that he was smart, but it&#8217;s that understanding that you may have all the qualifications in the world, you don&#8217;t fit our ethos and our culture of how we are going to serve customers, it doesn&#8217;t work. Whereas somebody who didn&#8217;t have any of the experience. And what&#8217;s funny, Gabe, is that our hiring manager, because we take a lot of chances, said, &#8220;I&#8217;ve got to get somebody who&#8217;s qualified in CX.&#8221; I said, &#8220;You gotta meet him.&#8221; And she did. And she&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m throwing it out the window.&#8221; I mean, literally like, no, we have to hire him because we know our customers and we know how they&#8217;re going to love it.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (10:43)<br />
And then, and here&#8217;s my last one. I might be up to six and I think you, as a marketer &#8211;</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (10:47)<br />
It may be six. But I love it. Keep it up.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (10:47)<br />
You as the marketer, it is working in partnership with your marketing partners as well. We talked about those C-suite, but I want to pull one forward, whether it&#8217;s your consumer marketing and you&#8217;re doing that with your customer advocacy. But if you have that culture, let that be expressed in your personality. And I think we all know that Zappos, they&#8217;re a great example, but perspective on how they let that personality come through. Yext does it in the B2B with some of the events that we do. And once we went virtual, we started a whole series called Truth Be Told, and our customers said, &#8220;You kept letting your culture come through in these virtual events. You guys have been able to do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (11:31)<br />
So whether you&#8217;re at Zappos, but I think really working with your marketing partner on how you express that and that can come through in how you respond to tickets and customer support. And having that in working and working with, what are we going to say? What&#8217;s the message of the month? And bringing all those connection points. So what I say to people in CX is it can be hard, but you have to understand that you&#8217;ve got an incredible mouthpiece and a megaphone because we wake up every day being passionate about our customers. And it&#8217;s doing that across all of these different ways internally. So I hope that&#8217;s where I really wanted to spend the time talking.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (12:11)<br />
I like that one, a couple of those things that jumped out. The rolling NPS, that, keeping it top of mind. I might need to talk to you after about that one, because that&#8217;s something I feel like a lot of companies miss. It&#8217;s this grand event once a year.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (12:28)<br />
The other thing I&#8217;ll say, Gabe, that I didn&#8217;t call out, if you&#8217;re making changes on pricing, or you have new products, when you&#8217;re in an always on, you can start to get market feedback more quickly as well from your NPS. So I didn&#8217;t call that out as another benefit.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (12:43)<br />
Interesting. Well, I want to click on one thing you said earlier, just about the international aspect. Definitely looking at companies growing globally, certainly some with the pressure of the economy, companies have gotten more requests. Some people got less requests, but scaling to a global standard is on a lot of people&#8217;s minds. You&#8217;ve touched on it earlier. What are some of the lessons learned? You&#8217;re a little more of a hands-on CEO. You&#8217;ve got, you&#8217;re battle tested. How&#8217;d you win? How&#8217;d you lose?</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (13:13)<br />
Yeah. Well, look, I think I will be honest with you. I think one of the biggest partnerships that you need to, and this is the other one we didn&#8217;t talk about before, is with your finance department. Because you are going to have to really understand the models from revenue and scaling. And what we found, which was a huge issue for us as we started to grow in multiple markets, is that our models just, we had kind of the revenue models right, but we didn&#8217;t have the right countries. What do I mean? We were doing much better in France than we were in Germany. Now flip flops. And so I needed more French support heads than I needed German and my model and because of the hiring lag times in Europe and the notice periods, and so I said, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t going to work.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (14:00)<br />
And I worked with my CX leader who&#8217;s an amazing CX leader in Europe. And so we have not been a big outsourcer partner. We did everything in house and we just realized how to scale, I couldn&#8217;t turn it on and off because as my French team blew out the numbers in a quarter, all of a sudden I needed another French support head and I was hiring and noticing periods. It might be a six months best case before they showed up. I&#8217;ve got French customers who need support now. It was a huge issue. And so we had never been big believers in outsourcing, but we went and it&#8217;s now you&#8217;re using them globally. It&#8217;s an interesting format in Romania, and we can turn on heads within a month. So once I have that, and so I do a ton of modeling with my finance team, we understand down to country level, the regional level, and then we monitor it because it&#8217;s just, it can be in precise, especially if you&#8217;re in a higher growth.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (14:58)<br />
I think if you&#8217;re in a pretty steady state, it&#8217;s probably easier. But when you&#8217;re in a high growth, you just can&#8217;t predict. My Scandinavian team didn&#8217;t do as well as I wanted, but then, and then, oh my God, I was doing really well in Saudi Arabia, but I didn&#8217;t understand, like you have to have people working on Sundays. So you got to really, and so your HR partners and your finance partners, because you also have work restrictions. So like, this is a kind of thing for the people that are international will understand. And we started blowing up in the Middle East, our support teams, our European, where we had a lot of our multilingual people were in Germany, it&#8217;s illegal to ask workers to work on a Sunday. Saudi Arabia, you have to work on Sunday. We&#8217;re going to hire Arabic speakers out of, so just if you&#8217;re in a high growth area where you&#8217;re learning about the international markets, you got to go sit down with your local HR team, your finance team, and really get aligned on your planning because there&#8217;s a lot of gotchas.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (15:59)<br />
I like it. The consideration of outsourcing. Sometimes I think people get nervous about that, but you&#8217;re right. And to be able to pull levers like that and be able to get rid of that ramp time and switching costs, costs and time.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (16:12)<br />
And then the other one that I would say is then that&#8217;s where having, we had made an investment in a technology platform to allow us to drive our processes globally. Well, you&#8217;ve got to think through what, I&#8217;m actually talking to a company now, advising them a little bit. And they went very hardcore regional, so they got their five and they&#8217;re a hugely global company. They&#8217;re a $150 million company now, but with a huge footprint in Asia, Europe, the US, having problems because they now are getting big global customers. And the customer experience is very disconnected from each region. So I think you&#8217;ve got to do it maybe earlier than you think. And there&#8217;s, and again, I love that, I think it&#8217;s one of the ways they were able to get to 150 million. They got there really quickly because the market, really quickly, like in four years, holy moly. But, it&#8217;s in the FinTech space, but they, now they&#8217;re having real problems because they&#8217;re working with customers globally and they&#8217;re trying to build these huge 10, $20 million relationships. And the customers are saying, &#8220;This is a mess. I can&#8217;t work with you the way that I want to strategically, because everything is different in every region.&#8221; So you gotta find that balance.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (17:24)<br />
Yeah. Finding the right time to do that, though. Investing in the future is never easy. It&#8217;s always, you know better than I do.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (17:32)<br />
No, no, no. Well look, and that&#8217;s that battle with the C-suite because sometimes, we&#8217;re going to want to do that and people are going to say, &#8220;That can wait.&#8221; So that&#8217;s part of this battle and getting really smart about the KPIs and telling the story, because it&#8217;s hard. I had to fight to get them to the technologies that I wanted when I was the Chief Customer Officer and even some of the things that I wanted to do in Europe, and then the last thing that I would say is understand, finding that balance between where you can drive consistency. So for example, many people on the call will relate to this. The customer review platforms are extraordinarily different in Europe than they are in the US. And so you&#8217;ve got to understand that and our US teams weren&#8217;t paying any attention to that.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (18:15)<br />
We were getting, we had some people saying some not so good things, and we weren&#8217;t trying to solicit at all our great advocates. And we started having customers and prospects say, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221; And then we fixed it because we just hadn&#8217;t paid it any attention. And our US team was like, &#8220;Oh, I didn&#8217;t even know that that platform existed.&#8221; There&#8217;s one called Trustpilot in Europe. It&#8217;s just very different. And it&#8217;s a very minor player in the US but a very significant player for both consumer and B2B companies. It&#8217;s a big one in Europe. And so you&#8217;ve got that, if you&#8217;ve got a global role, you&#8217;ve got to be able to drive consistency, find that balance, but also allow for those and understand and empower your teams to come to you. So we didn&#8217;t just say, &#8220;We don&#8217;t care.&#8221; We said, &#8220;Okay, we&#8217;ll fix it. We&#8217;ve got to go address Trustpilot because that&#8217;s important for us.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (19:01)<br />
Wow. That&#8217;s so many unique experiences in different geographies, different lands. And so I didn&#8217;t realize Saudi Arabia was on that. I spent a couple of years in Saudi Arabia. I could have shared some secrets.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (19:12)<br />
I have not been to be, and I mean, that&#8217;s a whole other thing. My husband was like, and I could go, but I&#8217;ll be honest. My whole CX Team, we were all women and I&#8217;m a woman and we actually told the Sales team who just happened to be a guy and his boss. We said, &#8220;You know what? You guys should go.&#8221; I can cover and do it. And that&#8217;s, we have to play to each other&#8217;s strengths. And I was like, &#8220;You know what? I could go and it would be a fascinating experience, but right now I&#8217;m not ready to try to change cultural norms in Saudi Arabia.&#8221; I&#8217;ll let our team go and yeah, but it is also a really good region. You&#8217;ve lived there. You&#8217;d know. There was a lot of money and a lot of business.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (19:53)<br />
Oh my goodness. So many fun things going on and a lot of positives.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (19:57)<br />
Fantastic. Yeah. So again, how do you scale your team knowing that they&#8217;re different cultures? Just gotta be intellectually honest about it. You can&#8217;t take it personally.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (20:05)<br />
I think that makes a huge difference. As we wrap, I wanted to get this last piece of advice from you. We&#8217;ve got so many things kind of colliding at once with all the changes in the economy and the health and all this stuff going on, consumer digitization, you know the spiel. All these CX leaders trying to kind of mind through these different challenges, from your perspective, what&#8217;s that piece of advice? We&#8217;ve hit a lot of different areas, but the thing you&#8217;d want to leave with them as they try to navigate and still have those transformational experiences amidst the ever-changing environment that we&#8217;re in?</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (20:38)<br />
Yeah. I mean, listen. I think this is the time to be bold. I think that C-suites and boardrooms, their deals, in Germany, for example, are very conservative, supervisory boards. We&#8217;ve had programs that we&#8217;ve been talking to companies, super conservative German companies, things got green-lit this year that we&#8217;ve been talking to companies for years because the board said we have to change. And so I think this is the time to be bold and to really not be afraid. I know these are scary times, but we can control what we can control. And that&#8217;s all we can do in these times where there&#8217;s so many things around us that we can&#8217;t control. We are concerned for our kids and their safety in schools. And so really seize this moment because I can say, I am on a public company board as well, The Container Store, which is a great honor and a gift, and we have amazing CX leaders there. We are having conversations that are probably accelerated years. So know that when we talk about that alignment at the C-suite, but this is a time to be bold and to seize this, and it can allow you to make your mark on your company. But I promise you that these conversations are happening because I see it in my own business or I did, and I see it at The Container Store. So, it can be scary, but let&#8217;s be bold because the world is changed in ways that we don&#8217;t even understand.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (22:02)<br />
Change or be changed. I love that.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (22:02)<br />
I really believe this is an opportunity for everyone who&#8217;s listening to really think about it and whatever your role is in the organization.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (22:14)<br />
Love it. Well we&#8217;ll leave it with that. Be bold. It&#8217;s a great mantra for 2021. Wendi, thanks so much for joining.</p>
<p>Wendi Sturgis: (22:19)<br />
I loved it. It was always great to talk to you, Gabe. Thank you.</p>

Thank you and for the audience, have a fantastic day.</p>

<p>In this episode of the <em>Customer Service Secrets Podcast</em>, Gabe Larsen is joined by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/slearmartin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shannon Martin</a> to learn about building a 90 day roadmap to successful customer service. Learn how Shannon has built an excellent team to provide world class customer service by listening to the podcast below. </p>
<h3>Problem Solving Through Connection</h3>
<p>Senior Director of Travel Partners Group at <a href="https://www.expediagroup.com/home/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Expedia Group</a>, Shannon, reveals the secrets to structuring a successful CX team with a 90 day roadmap. The first step to 90 day success is to build a connection through asking questions. Doing so is sure to uncover problems that need to be solved within the brand that customers are experiencing. This is an especially effective way to cater the ultimate consumer experience because this method is created by design-led thinking. When asked to evaluate a design-led thinking company culture, Shannon says, “Even though it’s a bit of a buzzword today, I do think customer service professionals have done this for years because our concern is always what’s the impact of the customer? What is their experience finding the problems?” By asking questions to the customer and further quantifying problems that need to be solved as a result, a company becomes more vigilant and better customer service outcomes are sure to ensue. </p>
<h3>Testing Promising Opportunities</h3>
<p>The next step of the 90 day roadmap is to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/adrianswinscoe/2015/02/02/how-to-implement-an-effective-proactive-customer-service-strategy/?sh=15fca5bf650e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">test and learn based on the data gathered</a>. Once these problems have been identified, it is important for CX leaders to look at all of the options to find the most promising opportunities. As Shannon says, “You really want to pick a few promising opportunities, the ones that look like you’re going to get the biggest bang for your buck. And there’s no guarantee that those will be the one, but it will give you a place to start.” </p>
<p>A prime example of testing and learning was when Shannon’s team identified how to better provide a customer experience. She understands how difficult it can be for brands that have CX teams across the globe to implement change. Shannon believes that one of the best ways to effectively implement tests and change is to start with a focus group and if said group shows positive results, change can then be implemented globally. To do this, Shannon’s test group displayed a more consultative approach to CX, rather than that of a strictly problem solving approach. Additionally, her team cut all handle times and allowed the agents to provide service at their will without constraint. This ultimately led to higher customer satisfaction scores, employee satisfaction scores and a profound increase in revenue.</p>
<h3>Slow Down for Success</h3>
<p>The final step to creating and actualizing an effective 90 day roadmap is to take things piece by piece and day by day. Something a lot of newer brands evidently struggle with is they tend to overleap oneself and become overwhelmed with amounting problems that need solving. Shannon’s solution is to find the right opportunities and to create change in small and effective steps. She mentions:</p>
<blockquote><p>Everybody’s like, “Oh, I need to fix these 20 different things in my first 90 days.” No, you don’t. You definitely cannot do that. It’s impossible. But if you can find a few promising things where you can start to make incremental change, over time, incremental change actually becomes huge. And that’s really the only thing that you could easily expect in the first 90 days is, where can I make some really promising, incremental change?</p></blockquote>
<p>Starting from scratch and working in small steps can bring long-term benefits and success. Working each day towards a goal and doing what is necessary in increments to achieve that goal can help launch CX teams to their biggest wins.</p>
<p>CX and CS leaders alike could greatly benefit by using Shannon’s 90 day roadmap to customer service excellence. Identifying problems by creating a connection and asking targeted questions, testing and learning from data, and solving problems day by day have all proven to transcend teams to CX greatness.</p>

<p>Shannon Martin: (00:30)<br />
I am great. It&#8217;s a lovely rainy day here in Texas, which for most people may not be exciting, but for Texas, it&#8217;s a great day.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (00:39)<br />
I love it. I love it. Well we appreciate you joining and want to jump into some of the lessons learned from your cool career. But before we do that, maybe tell us just a little bit more about your background.</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (00:51)<br />
Sure. Even though I am part of the Travel Partners Group at Expedia now, prior to that, I was the Head of Global Customer Experience Operations for HomeAway, which became Vrbo, which was acquired by Expedia.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (01:06)<br />
Yes.</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (01:06)<br />
So I&#8217;ve got at least 20 years, I don&#8217;t want to say exactly how many, in the customer service world, starting with frontline management and then going all the way through to everything that supports customer service.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (01:19)<br />
Awesome. Awesome. Well, yeah. You look at, check out her LinkedIn and you&#8217;ll find that she is, she&#8217;s seen the movie once or twice, so it&#8217;d be fun to kind of dive into this idea of starting up and optimizing your customer excellence transformation. So let&#8217;s start at the top. As people think, I think this is one of the big challenges, I&#8217;m new to a job. I&#8217;m thinking about trying to kind of optimize the structure, the strategy, but there&#8217;s so much coming at me. How do you start? How do you start thinking about this 90 day plan of being able to just do it and do it right?</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (01:52)<br />
Well, if you&#8217;re coming into a new company, you obviously don&#8217;t know what you don&#8217;t know. The big thing these days is design-led thinking. Take your approach to those first 90 days in that design-led thinking framework, then you realize the first thing you need to do is figure out what problems you need to solve. And then from there you can start thinking about, &#8220;All right, I&#8217;ve figured out a problem. What are some of the things that I might be able to address?&#8221; And then start designing some tests to see if you can actually make a difference in those areas? Because even those incremental tests could start to show you some goodness that you can expand on in a broader base later.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (02:34)<br />
I, yeah, this design-led thinking. It seems to be a little bit of a buzz, not a buzzword, but something that I think not everybody knows about. Could you just double click on that a little bit because it does, it is for some, a newer phenomenon. How would you explain that? What is it?</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (02:49)<br />
What&#8217;s funny about it is in the customer service world, I think customer service people are naturally designed to do this, but you always want to start with the customer&#8217;s problem. What problem are you trying to solve? And so once you understand what problem you&#8217;re trying to solve, then you can think about, &#8220;Okay, what are the processes that impact that problem? How does a customer get to the point where they have that problem?&#8221; And then you start looking at breaking that problem apart and what can you then fix? And then it all becomes a question of testing; test and learn. How do you tweak this one thing? Does it make a difference? How do you, and then expand that to different parts of the process? So even though it&#8217;s a bit of a buzzword today, I do think customer service professionals have done this for years because our concern is always what&#8217;s the impact on the customer? What&#8217;s their experience finding the problems?</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (03:44)<br />
I like that. I like that you&#8217;re right. In some ways it&#8217;s been around for a while, but it does take a couple of new avenues, a little bit more structure in the way that you kind of talked about it, right? Problem and process and product and bringing those all together. Let&#8217;s maybe double click into some of those thoughts. I like the design-led thinking of how you then approach those 90 days. Where do you typically start?</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (04:03)<br />
Gosh, the first thing is you need to go out and you gather your data right on the problem. And the best way to gather the data is talking to people. This is actually a twofold benefit. Not only can you start to understand the customer&#8217;s problems and concerns, but you start to build relationships with the people on the front lines. At VRBO, our customer service agents talk to 10,000 people a year.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (04:29)<br />
Wow.</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (04:29)<br />
And my joke was they had the Vulcan mind meld with their customers. If you wanted to know how something was going to go over with a customer, talk to customer service agents. So that&#8217;s where I start, like just getting their information, getting in their ideas, round tables and surveys, and just going down to someone&#8217;s desk and saying, &#8220;Hey, what are you seeing? What are you hearing today about X, Y, and Z?&#8221; So again, not only are you starting to gather your data on what the customer problems are, you&#8217;re also hearing directly from the folks that probably have ideas on how to solve those problems and building the relationships with those teams. It&#8217;s all gonna give you a lot more trust in grace when you start to suggest some changes later.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (05:14)<br />
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, people feel, I feel like people, they do try to get to their customers, but sometimes they don&#8217;t get the information they want out of it. It&#8217;s like, I love that you kind of talk about this idea of building connections by asking questions. Are there certain ways you&#8217;ve found to get the right information out? Is it about structuring the right questions? Is it about just getting to the right people or making sure you get to the right customers or any thoughts on kind of that double click on actually extracting some of the goodness out?</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (05:43)<br />
There&#8217;s so many frameworks and how you can do it. I have usually taken a little bit more of an unstructured approach and I might start out with, &#8220;Hey, what are you hearing about our billing issues right now?&#8221; And it&#8217;s something, I mean, that seems like a fairly broad topic and there can be lots of questions or lots of answers that could come about. But oftentimes agents have something that&#8217;s very top of mind and they&#8217;ll say, &#8220;Well, what we&#8217;re seeing right now is that refunds are taking more than the normal amount of time.&#8221; &#8220;Okay. Tell me more,&#8221; and it really becomes like, &#8220;Tell me more, tell me more,&#8221; once you have that breadcrumb to go after, then you can actually start looking at more structured data to figure out how big the problem is. So if you&#8217;re seeing a payment issue in New Zealand, like, &#8220;Okay, what payment provider are we using in New Zealand?&#8221; Well we&#8217;re using this particular one, I&#8217;m not gonna name names. And so then you actually start, you go to the case management system. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, how many contacts did we have? How many bookings do we have? Okay, we&#8217;ve got a fairly good percentage of things that are not happening.&#8221; And then you go to engineering and it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Okay, are we seeing anything happening here?&#8221; So you start gathering all your data now that you have that breadcrumb or that starting point that identifies a problem. Because once you, you have some anecdotal problems, but then you need to quantify them. How big of a problem is it?</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (07:13)<br />
Yeah. Yeah. I was thinking as you said the, &#8220;Tell me more, tell me more,&#8221; concept of somebody saying something like that. They said the five whys. It&#8217;s like you&#8217;re having a problem, why? Well this. Well, why? Well, why? And pretty soon after the fifth one they said, usually you&#8217;ve got down to the root cause of what&#8217;s really driving this person or what they care most about, or what&#8217;s really kind of putting them in that position. That, &#8220;Tell me more,&#8221; that&#8217;s fun. I&#8217;d forgotten that. Okay. So getting the connections and asking the right questions is number one. Where do you kind of go next, as you think about this road map and this design-led thinking transformation?</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (07:52)<br />
Right? The normal, the thing that we normally look at, so before you come up with a specific solution, right, you have to, there&#8217;s some policy process kind of the softer things that you need to figure out. And in that case, you also want to look at all your options. So let&#8217;s say you identified 20 different problems like, &#8220;Okay, I&#8217;m going to narrow it down. What are just a couple of promising opportunities that we have here?&#8221; And they could make a small change that can make a big difference, or it could be a big change that happens that fixes every customer. That&#8217;s like, not as likely, but you really want to pick a few promising opportunities, the ones that look like you&#8217;re going to get the biggest bang for your buck. And there&#8217;s no guarantee that those will be the one, but it will give you a place to start. It will help you feel like you&#8217;re not boiling the ocean, right? Everybody&#8217;s like, &#8220;Oh, I need to fix these 20 different things in my first 90 days.&#8221; No, you don&#8217;t. You definitely cannot do that. It&#8217;s impossible. But if you can find a few promising things where you can start to make incremental change, over time, incremental change actually becomes huge. And that&#8217;s really the only thing that you could easily expect in the first 90 days is, where can I make some really promising, incremental change?</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (09:17)<br />
Yeah. You, and this might go into your back on a little bit but I&#8217;m always interested. As you&#8217;ve gone through some of these exercises, and you found some of these few promising opportunities, have there ever been some surprises where you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh man, here&#8217;s a fun one. A fun part of the process that we could change or part of the customer experience, or even something in the employee experience, that we could change that would ultimately kind of produce bigger results.&#8221; Anything comes to mind that again, some of these maybe few promising opportunities that you&#8217;ve found in different situations?</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (09:54)<br />
I&#8217;m trying to think. We, there have been so many along the way. I&#8217;m just thinking of something particularly goofy that springs to mind but, there&#8217;s a whole idea just in how you finish your call, right? You never want to leave the customer with a negative, right? So the standard question has always been, &#8220;Is there anything else I can do for you?&#8221; Well, the answer then is no, which is a negative and that&#8217;s not necessarily how you want to end a call.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (10:25)<br />
Oh, interesting. Interesting.</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (10:25)<br />
And so we actually tweaked how our agents completed their calls and said, &#8220;Have I answered everything for you today?&#8221; And, and at that point, then the customer has the opportunity to say, &#8220;Yeah, actually you have,&#8221; or &#8220;No, wait a minute. I have one more thing.&#8221; Just that one small thing, again, very small thing in the process. And we saw a shift in our customer satisfaction scores.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (10:51)<br />
I love that.</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (10:51)<br />
Customers were left feeling more positive, especially in a case where the agent had no ability to change the outcome, right? So it&#8217;s perhaps a policy thing, or perhaps in our case, a traveler was unable to get a refund from the property owner because of the property owner&#8217;s policies, whatever the case may be. But it definitely helped the customer recognize that now this agent has done everything they can, and it was reflected on the customer satisfaction scores.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (11:21)<br />
I like that. No, that&#8217;s fine. I appreciate that because sometimes it is those small and simple things that lead to big changes, big results. And sometimes those are the things you need to be able to find, especially if you&#8217;re new or you&#8217;re trying to map out that. It&#8217;s always, I feel like quick wins. If you can find some of those things while you work on the bigger pieces that allow everybody to be satisfied. You, your boss, your customers, your employees, everyone wins.</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (11:47)<br />
Yeah. [Inaudible] Hear about it. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh yeah, that&#8217;s kind of nice to be able to say that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (11:52)<br />
I like that. Okay. So we have to build connections&#8211;kind of getting the questions right, simplify it down, focus on some of those quick wins or find those promising opportunities. I like the way you talked about it. Then where do you go last here?</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (12:07)<br />
And the last one is where it can really be fun and sometimes requires a little bit more creativity. And that&#8217;s where you test and learn. So you&#8217;ve identified your promising, some places to start and you need to be able to test your theory. And again, if you&#8217;re going to make a small change and you have 3,000 agents globally, you&#8217;re not going to be able to test it across 3,000 agents. Like that&#8217;s just too much to ask, but you identify a set of agents, maybe in a single region, or even a single team, depending on how much time you have so that you can have them try something just to get a signal. So we had an interesting test that we ran, because we were trying to get our agents to shift from strictly problem solving to being more consultative. And when we first started it, they were struggling with that. They&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not a salesperson.&#8221; Like, &#8220;We know that, but you&#8217;re helping the partner or customer run their business better with our tools. So you have the technology, you can teach them and consult with them on how to do that better.&#8221; Well, guess what happens when you go into consultation mode and you&#8217;re having these great conversations? Your handle times go up. So then our agents were struggling with trying to, we didn&#8217;t cap handle times, but everyone kind of watches handle times. And so we ran a test and said, &#8220;Okay, no holds barred. You guys are no longer being monitored. We&#8217;re not even gonna look at handle times for you in this test, all so that you can do this consultation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (13:51)<br />
Wow. Wow. Awesome. Awesome.</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (13:55)<br />
In the results that we saw, customer satisfaction went up, employee satisfaction went up, revenue went up because those partners were learning how to do their business better. And we saw a return based on the revenue that came back to the company on the accounts that were in that test group. So it was one of those things that we got enough signal on that test. And I think we ran it for three months, that particular one. I was like, &#8220;All right, this is how we&#8217;re going to run it going forward,&#8221; because we know giving up control over that handle time, allowing the agents the freedom to have those great conversations with our partners, led to an overall better experience for everyone.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (14:38)<br />
Yeah. Wow. I love that, the idea of kind of nail it and scale it. You got to find a small group of people that you can inject that change on and then see if you can actually do it. I love the idea. So funny, we find ourselves, as you were talking, I&#8217;m just, we think we&#8217;re being customer obsessed sometimes because we&#8217;re looking at things like handle time. But really that&#8217;s actually disabling the customer to have a better experience because we&#8217;re so interested in this metric, but yet we think we&#8217;re being customer obsessed, but really we&#8217;re being customer not obsessed. But &#8211;</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (15:16)<br />
Metric obsessed. Yeah.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (15:16)<br />
It&#8217;s interesting that sometimes the metrics can not lead you astray, but sometimes they can give you mixed messages. I&#8217;m feeling, I&#8217;m hearing that a lot. Like people are like, &#8220;Well, my numbers are good, but my overall customer experience is not good.&#8221; It&#8217;s like &#8211;</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (15:36)<br />
I always say you get the behavior that you encourage. And if you&#8217;re encouraging shorter handle times, the agents, they&#8217;re smart. They&#8217;re going to figure out how to whip through those things and move customers through faster even though they may not want to.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (15:53)<br />
Yeah. Oh, fascinating. I need to send this recording to a few people. So, okay. Well Shannon, we really appreciate your time. As we kind of think about wrapping, we&#8217;d love to just get a quick summary from you. You hit a bunch of different things, but you&#8217;ve got different CX leaders, CS leaders out there trying to kind of get this transformation or get into this excellence mindset. What&#8217;s that last piece of advice you kind of leave with them?</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (16:18)<br />
If you get just a tiny bit better every day, then at the end of the year, you&#8217;re going to look back and you&#8217;re going to see, &#8220;Wow, we&#8217;ve made some incredible improvements.&#8221; So, it really is those tiny steps. As long as you&#8217;re doing everything you can to get a little bit better every day, you&#8217;re going to get big wins down the road.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (16:37)<br />
So yeah, that&#8217;s the small crawl, walk, run, I&#8217;ve often said. Crawl, walk, run. So if someone wants to get in touch with you or continue the dialogue, what&#8217;s the best way to do that?</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (16:48)<br />
Definitely on LinkedIn. So Shannon Martin, and I guess the LinkedIn handle is S-L-E-A-R Martin.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (16:55)<br />
And I can attest, she does respond. That&#8217;s how I found her, on LinkedIn. So she does respond.</p>
<p>Shannon Martin: (17:03)<br />
Definitely. Definitely. Always willing to share.</p>
<p>Gabe Larsen: (17:03)<br />
Awesome. Okay. Well, I really appreciate the time today, Shannon, and for the audience, have a fantastic day.</p>
