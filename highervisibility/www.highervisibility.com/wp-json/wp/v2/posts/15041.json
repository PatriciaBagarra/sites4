The way that you craft your online presence will say a lot about your business to your potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>Once upon a time, it was your storefront that customers saw first, and that was the most important way that you could make a positive first impression on them.<\/p>\n<p>But in the modern business world, it\u2019s all about your website.<\/p>\n<p>Most customers will find you through search engines like Google. That means their first impression is established through your website.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, you need a good looking and functional website if you want to succeed.<\/p>\n<p>Many businesses choose to outsource their web development or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/4-signs-its-time-to-invest-in-a-website-redesign-tips-to-get-started\/\">website redesign<\/a> services rather than hire an in-house designer.<\/p>\n<p>But why do people outsource? And what steps should you take to ensure you succeed when outsourcing your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/website-design\/\">web design<\/a>?<\/p>\n<p>Read on to find out.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Why_Should_You_Outsource\">Why Should You Outsource?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Web design outsourcing can be beneficial for businesses of all sizes. It will allow your business to maintain and scale while still getting an original website with an optimized user experience.<\/p>\n<p>But there are also a lot of website builders out there specifically designed to help business owners with no technical knowledge create a website for very little money.<\/p>\n<p>So, again, why outsource?<\/p>\n<p>For starters, there\u2019s time commitments.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re concerned with creating a website, you\u2019re not going to have the time needed to dedicate yourself to the actual running of your company.<\/p>\n<p>Time is a precious resource for an entrepreneur or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/what-do-small-businesses-know-about-seo\/\">small business<\/a> owner, and you\u2019re going to be better suited to allowing an outside party to tackle this vital task while you focus up on keeping the business moving forward.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re also going to be able to get a more personalized website design if you\u2019re working with a professional website development team.<\/p>\n<p>These <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/ecommerce-website-builders\/\">website builders<\/a> are typically on rails, providing you with templates that you either aren\u2019t allowed to edit, or aren\u2019t skilled enough to edit.<\/p>\n<p>You might think that bringing on a full time developer would be better in the long run for your business, but that\u2019s not cost effective.<\/p>\n<p>On top of paying the salary of your new full time employee, you\u2019re also dealing with bonuses, benefits, and the cost of hiring a new staff member, which can be up to <a href=\"https:\/\/toggl.com\/blog\/cost-of-hiring-an-employee#:~:text=Another%20study%20by%20the%20Society%20for%20Human%20Resource,up%20to%2052%20days%20to%20fill%20a%20position.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$4,129<\/a> on average in 2020.<\/p>\n<p>Not only is hiring a development team more affordable, it\u2019s also more efficient for web development services.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re working with a single in house designer, you have one person working on your site. When you outsource to a web developer, you often have an entire team of dedicated web design professionals working for you at a fraction of the cost.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"Outsource_Your_Web_Design_Work_to_Our_Team\">Outsource Your Web Design Work to Our Team<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many agencies and businesses white-label our services under your brand.

(This also gives you ample time to dictate necessary changes to remain within your agreed upon time window.)<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Let\u2019s dive into these steps one at a time, examining how you can accomplish each and why they&#8217;re important.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Step_1_Clearly_Define_Your_Goals_and_Budget\">Step 1: Clearly Define Your Goals and Budget<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Before you start your search for a outsourcing company, you have to first outline what your goals are for this web development project.<\/p>\n<p>What kind of website do you want? What does it need to do? What do you need out of the user interface? Are there specific features you don\u2019t need?<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15043\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/design-checklist.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"468\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/design-checklist.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/design-checklist-533x400.png 533w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.slideshare.net\/Adoriasoft\/web-designer-tips-by-adoriasoft\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The more information you determine before you start your search, the more likely you are to find someone who can do exactly what you need them to do.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t know what you need the web development company to do, you run the risk of hiring someone who won\u2019t be able to deliver on what you need. That\u2019s a major problem and might cause you to revert back to square one.<\/p>\n<p>You can avoid this potential issue by clearly defining your goals from the start.<\/p>\n<p>In order to do that you\u2019re going to have to understand your audience completely.<\/p>\n<p>That means <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/creating-buyer-personas\/\">creating a series of buyer personas<\/a> that outline your most common customers.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15044\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/persona-example.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"585\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/persona-example.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/persona-example-533x500.png 533w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/persona-example-427x400.png 427w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/marketinginsidergroup.com\/strategy\/5-reasons-buyer-personas-arent-good-enough\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You have to know what problems they&#8217;re trying to solve, what they like to see, how they like to interact with your company, and, perhaps most importantly, what they <i>don\u2019t <\/i>like.<\/p>\n<p>By understanding exactly what your ideal customers are looking for, you\u2019re able to more accurately create an online user experience that appeals to them.<\/p>\n<p>After all, your target audience are the people you\u2019re designing this website for in the first place. If you don\u2019t understand them, you have a really big problem.<\/p>\n<p>Just because certain trends are \u201cin\u201d right now from a web design perspective doesn\u2019t mean that your audience will appreciate or enjoy them. That\u2019s why you have to also make sure that your developers understand the wants and needs of your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s your budget.<\/p>\n<p>That has to be set before you start your search, if only in the interest of time. By being up front with a development company about your budgetary needs, you\u2019ll be able to weed out options that are too expensive without listening to a long and involved pitch.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, company pitches usually don\u2019t touch on pricing until the end. You don\u2019t want to sit through a series of 30-minute presentations just to be smashed with a massive cost estimate.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re able to be up front and say, \u201cthis is what I need and this is what I\u2019m able to spend,\u201d you\u2019ll be able to quickly narrow your search when it comes time to choose the right vendor.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Step_2_Search_for_the_Right_Company\">Step 2: Search for the Right Company<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You need to find the right company to contract with. That way you\u2019ll know from the start that the website you want is the website that you\u2019re getting.<\/p>\n<p>After you\u2019ve outlined your goals, make a list of questions that you can ask the potential design companies that you interact with. This will help you create a pre-screening process which will allow you to weed out any companies that aren\u2019t offering what you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re also going to want to take a look at the company\u2019s experience and, most importantly, portfolio.<\/p>\n<p>Not only are you looking for quality functional work, you\u2019re also looking to see if they have any experience catering to your audience.<\/p>\n<p>If they don\u2019t, that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that you should disqualify them. But, if you\u2019re a dentist and the companies you\u2019re speaking with have experience creating websites for dental offices, there\u2019s going to be a much smaller learning curve.<\/p>\n<p>Next, ask about their specializations and capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re going to have certain needs from a website perspective. If you want a site that features a reservation creation platform, you need to make sure that the company you contract with has experience and understanding regarding the creation of this feature.<\/p>\n<p>Then there\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/ecommerce-seo-services\/\">eCommerce<\/a>, which is a hot button issue right now.<\/p>\n<p>The eCommerce industry is booming.

If there are no reviews for a web design firm, that in and of itself is a huge red flag.<\/p>\n<p>See what past clients have to say about the companies you\u2019re considering. A lot of times you\u2019ll be able to find some good information through the experiences of others.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind, you might have to do some homework and travel off the beaten path to get a full overview of how a company\u2019s clients perceive them after an outsourced project is complete.<\/p>\n<p>Obviously, most companies are going to tout their successes and hide their failures.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why you need to look through third party listings like a Google My Business Page or social media reviews. This will help you get a more honest assessment of a web design company\u2019s true capabilities.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few criteria that you should check out when trying to make your decision.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Processes. <\/b>What are the steps that these businesses take in creating a custom web design? They should have the entire process outlined for you.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Communication. <\/b>How good is their communication? Do they speak your language fluently? How often are they willing to check in and provide updates?<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>Samples. <\/b>Are they willing to provide you with samples of their previous work?<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><b>References. <\/b>Are they willing to provide you with references from past clients? Are you allowed to talk with these clients?<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Make sure you don\u2019t just hop on board with the first company that says the right things. Shop around a bit, see what else is out there, and ask lots of questions.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve selected a company and you\u2019re moving forward, have them sign a Non Disclosure Agreement so that all of the details of your project remain private, even if the project falls through.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"Outsource_Your_Web_Design_Work_to_Our_Team-2\">Outsource Your Web Design Work to Our Team<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many agencies and businesses white-label our services under your brand.
