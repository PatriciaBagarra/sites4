Use keyword research to find low-hanging fruit<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you target the wrong keywords, you may not have a chance of ranking in the top results even if you invest multiple years.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you\u2019re a local John Deere tractor dealer, you shouldn\u2019t be focusing on the keyword \u201ctractor\u201d at all.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15079\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/tractor.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"200\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You\u2019d need an estimated 270 unique backlinks to break into the top results for that keyword.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, focus your keyword research on finding lower volume, less competitive keywords. That could be terms in your local area, like \u201ctractor dealer + city,\u201d or specific tips on tractor maintenance, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Keywords that you could consider \u201clow-hanging fruit\u201d have these three characteristics:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>An acceptable monthly volume (at least a few hundred searches)<\/li>\n<li>Some level of commercial intent (like a product category, name, location, etc.)<\/li>\n<li>Limited competition<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are no worthwhile keywords that have zero competition. That\u2019s the reality of doing SEO work in 2021 and beyond.<\/p>\n<p>But you can do your best to find keywords that match that sweet spot of limited competition, decent volume, and good search intent.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"2_Invest_in_a_quality_host_with_fast_loading_times_and_a_professional_design\">2. Invest in a quality host with fast loading times and a professional design<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If Google users who click through to your site have a horrible experience, it doesn\u2019t matter how good your keyword selection is.<\/p>\n<p>Page speed became an official ranking factor in <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/web\/updates\/2018\/07\/search-ads-speed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2018<\/a>. Plus, your loading times affect whether people stay on your page or not, which influences dwell time (another signal).<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/security.googleblog.com\/2014\/08\/https-as-ranking-signal_6.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">HTTPS<\/a> has been an official ranking signal since 2014, and Google Chrome and other browsers will single out your site as unsafe if it\u2019s still on HTTP.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15080\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/https.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"163\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Invest in a quality host that offers HTTPS, caching, and fast loading speeds.<\/p>\n<p>Professional <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/website-design\/\">website design<\/a> is another aspect that plays a crucial role in the user experience of your website. Design and usability is also factored into Google\u2019s algorithm\u2019s brand new <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2020\/05\/evaluating-page-experience\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">page experience<\/a> ranking factor.<\/p>\n<p>So, to sum up, a great-looking, easily navigated site that loads fast will boost the results from every other SEO tactic you implement.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"3_Eliminate_basic_on-page_errors_like_duplicate_content_and_broken_links\">3.

Start building backlinks by improving content quality and building relationships in your industry<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s not a secret that backlinks are the key to organic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/seo-spiders\/\">search engine<\/a> results. On the surface, it\u2019s a factor that hasn\u2019t changed much over the past decade.<\/p>\n<p>When more unique domains link to your page, it means higher rankings and more search traffic.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15082\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/referring-domains-search-traffic.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"653\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/referring-domains-search-traffic.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/referring-domains-search-traffic-478x500.png 478w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/referring-domains-search-traffic-382x400.png 382w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/search-traffic-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>But Google now also considers the quality and relevance of your links.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best white-hat tactics for building relevant, high-quality links is to network and build relationships with people in your industry.<\/p>\n<p>You can do this by identifying top bloggers and influencers by exploring competitors for your targeted keywords. Then there\u2019s also the art of building a rapport over social media. Twitter is a good starting point.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, they\u2019re not going to share low-quality, uninteresting, keyword-stuffed content just because they know you.<\/p>\n<p>You have to work hard to level up your content as well.<\/p>\n<p>Do this by:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Staying on topic.<\/li>\n<li>Developing your voice.<\/li>\n<li>Using visuals and graphs to show, not tell.<\/li>\n<li>Sharing unique research or case studies when possible.<\/li>\n<li>Reading and learning from the best blogs in your industry, but never copying or plagiarizing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Together, these things will help your organic social media presence, and lead to natural inbound links.<\/p>\n<p>If you then try a tactic like reaching out to blogs that link to an outdated resource, they\u2019re also much more likely to reward you with a link.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"5_For_faster_better_results_leave_it_to_the_experts\">5. For faster, better results, leave it to the experts<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re completely new to SEO, your head is probably already spinning from the first four tips.<\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that this is just scratching the surface of the discipline that is SEO.<\/p>\n<p>As a business owner, one of the keys to success is knowing when to delegate and outsource. If you want fast, powerful results from SEO, you\u2019re probably better off leaving it to the experts.<\/p>\n<p>Hiring a professional SEO agency could be the way to go, trusting in their experience and knowledge in order to catapult your page to the top of Google\u2019s search results.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you try to figure out the world of SEO on your own, you can forget the lower end of the time frame of just a few months to get results.<\/p>\n<p>With a DIY approach, you also have to learn cutting-edge techniques and best practices before you can even start waiting for results.<\/p>\n<p>Best case, you\u2019ll start seeing some improvements in six months to a year. In the worst-case scenario, you could fail to make any real improvements no matter how much time you invest.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have time for failure or waiting an extra year before seeing results, you should invest in professional SEO services.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"SEO_Takes_Time_Let_the_SEO_Agency_of_the_Year_Speed_it_up_for_You-3\">SEO Takes Time...
