Or maybe you have a website hosted elsewhere and you\u2019re just looking for a good deal on search engine optimization.<\/p>\n<p>Is the cost of GoDaddy SEO worth it?<\/p>\n<p>The online reviews aren\u2019t exactly glowing. GoDaddy SEO has even been called a \u201cscam.\u201d But GoDaddy claims that most of their clients make it to the first page\u202fof results for their targeted keywords.<\/p>\n<p>This article takes a look at just what GoDaddy has to offer and whether it\u2019s the best way to spend your SEO budget.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_is_GoDaddy_SEO\">What is GoDaddy SEO?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>GoDaddy offers two services designed to help with your SEO.<\/p>\n<p>The first is a DIY tool called GoDaddy Search Engine Optimization or GoDaddy Search Engine Visibility. It costs $6.99 per month and analyzes your website for keyword and phrase suggestions.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve implemented the suggested changes \u2014 for example, by changing your homepage title to include a keyword \u2014 you can track your site\u2019s search rankings on the Search Engine Optimization dashboard.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15337\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/godaddy-seo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/godaddy-seo.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/godaddy-seo-75x43.png 75w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.pcmag.com\/news\/godaddy-launches-new-seo-and-email-marketing-tool-for-smbs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Frankly, this SEO feature is really basic.<\/p>\n<p>Keyword suggestion and tracking tools are widely available, often for free. At the very least, you can find one that doesn\u2019t lock you into a 3+ month plan like GoDaddy does.<\/p>\n<p>Keywords are important, but in today\u2019s competitive SEO landscape, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/how-to-improve-your-seo\/\">they aren\u2019t nearly enough<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That brings us to GoDaddy\u2019s other SEO offering: managed services. This is GoDaddy\u2019s version of an SEO agency \u2014 you hand over your SEO work to GoDaddy\u2019s team for a fee.<\/p>\n<p>You can use GoDaddy SEO services whether you have a GoDaddy website already or use a different web host.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/seo-pricing\/\">cost of SEO<\/a> services from GoDaddy is customized to your business, but most reviews say it\u2019s cheaper than average. Is GoDaddy the secret to inexpensive SEO that works?<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"Why_Not_Work_with_the_2020_SEO_Agency_of_the_Year\">Why Not Work with the 2020 SEO Agency of the Year?<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped hundreds of businesses generate more online leads and sales through SEO. Let us do it for you!<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"Pros_and_cons_of_GoDaddy_SEO_services\">Pros and cons of GoDaddy SEO services<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A big advantage of GoDaddy SEO services is the price. While it\u2019s impossible to know how much you would pay for GoDaddy without getting a custom quote, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/SEO\/comments\/82jxpu\/psa_godaddy_seo_service_is_a_complete_scam\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">multiple<\/a> former <a href=\"https:\/\/dritschlermedia.com\/blog\/godaddy-seo-services-review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">users<\/a> of the SEO service say they paid $50 per hour.<\/p>\n<p>To put that in perspective, the average SEO agency in the US charges $<a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/seo-pricing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">134.66<\/a> per hour. What a good deal, right?<\/p>\n<p>There are a few other good things about GoDaddy SEO.<\/p>\n<p>The service sets you up with an account manager, and when that person isn\u2019t available, you can track developments in your site\u2019s SEO with an account dashboard.<\/p>\n<p>The managed services go beyond the keyword suggestions that the SEO tool provides by offering content development and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/link-building\/\">link building<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And of course, the main draw of any SEO service is that it takes search engine optimization out of your hands. You have a business to run, why not leave website optimization to an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/10-skills-every-seo-expert-should-have\/\">SEO expert<\/a>?<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"And_then_the_bad_news\">And then the bad news<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Before you run off to sign up for GoDaddy\u2019s SEO service, keep reading to see exactly what they\u2019re offering.<\/p>\n<p>Much like the DIY tool, the SEO service involves providing you with a list of keywords and the ability to track your rankings. You will be given \u201coptional but highly recommended\u201d onsite recommendations like updating your meta title and \u201cat least one image alt tag.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Hint: these things aren\u2019t optional for SEO, and they don\u2019t go far enough.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take an in-depth look at what\u2019s being offered and what you\u2019ll be missing out on:<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Building_backlinks\">Building backlinks<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>GoDaddy says they offer offsite optimization. Offsite SEO is also sometimes called link SEO. It involves building up the authority of your site by getting high-quality, respected websites to link back to yours.<\/p>\n<p>Link SEO is an area of search engine optimization that\u2019s changed a lot over the years. Sites used to be able to rank by buying low-quality links from link farms or using spammy techniques like linking from blog comments.<\/p>\n<p>But Google has gotten a lot better at recognizing a good link. These days, it\u2019s important to link from pages that are authoritative and relevant to your industry. For example, you could write a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/guest-posting-in-2020-how-to-do-it-and-get-crazy-results\/\">guest post<\/a> for the blog of an expert in your field.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s latest <a href=\"https:\/\/developers.google.com\/search\/blog\/2020\/06\/how-we-fought-search-spam-on-google\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">webspam report<\/a> shows that it\u2019s become more important than ever to go after these quality links, since Google is now catching more than 90% of link spam.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s what GoDaddy SEO services does for offsite SEO:<\/p>\n<p><strong>Business citation building. <\/strong>GoDaddy adds your site to directories like the Bing Business Portal, FourSquare, and Yahoo Listings. These huge directories don\u2019t really help your SEO much. It would be better to be listed on sites relevant to your industry or location.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Keyword link building. <\/strong>GoDaddy says, \u201cOur system finds applicable websites\u2026 we then compose a short, unique comment with the relevant content and keyword and include a link back to your site.\u201d In other words, comment spam.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Social bookmarking. <\/strong>The links GoDaddy has created are added to sites like Digg and Reddit. Social media can be beneficial in promoting content if you do it right, but the links are generally not good for SEO. Many are nofollow links, which is a way to indicate to search engines not to count them towards a site\u2019s authority.<\/p>\n<p>In general, GoDaddy\u2019s advertised offpage SEO strategies are useless at best and harmful at worst.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Content_creation\">Content creation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Content development is key to SEO. That\u2019s why companies spend <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">46%<\/a> of their budgets on it.<\/p>\n<p>GoDaddy makes no mention of content creation for your own site. Their content is aimed at providing backlinks from other sites. They offer blogs and articles.<\/p>\n<p>Blogs are \u201cshort articles, usually around two paragraphs, that use your keywords multiple times and link back to your website.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Two paragraphs is nothing. Google rewards content that it believes to be in-depth and informative. Consequently, the best blog posts for SEO are <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/how-long-should-your-blog-posts-be-faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2,100\u20132,400<\/a> words long.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15338\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/word-count-stat.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/word-count-stat.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/word-count-stat-585x400.png 585w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/seo-social-media-study\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, using your keywords multiple times in one of these 2,000 word articles is great. Using them multiple times in just two paragraphs sounds like keyword stuffing, which could get you penalized by Google.<\/p>\n<p>GoDaddy articles are longer and more thoroughly researched. They\u2019re posted to sites like Hubpages and Squidoo. These sites have some value to SEO, but they can\u2019t stack up to getting links from more relevant, authoritative sources.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"What_else_is_missing\">What else is missing?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Some of the most important factors in modern SEO aren\u2019t even mentioned on GoDaddy\u2019s website.<\/p>\n<p>Optimizing site speed is essential. As a page\u2019s load time slows from one second to 10 seconds, the probability of a mobile site visitor bouncing increases by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/marketing-strategies\/app-and-mobile\/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">123%<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Google currently uses mobile-first indexing. That means that optimizing your site for mobile is one of the most important things you can do. GoDaddy doesn\u2019t mention these technical aspects of SEO.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Good SEO is customized to your business and industry and includes <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/local-seo-company\/\">local SEO<\/a>. The techniques and sites GoDaddy talks about using are very general. A good SEO expert will focus on your unique needs.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"GoDaddy_SEO_Reviews\">GoDaddy SEO Reviews<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>There is plenty of commentary on GoDaddy SEO on the web.

But is the discounted price worth missing out on a few key SEO features?<\/p>\n<p>Probably not.<\/p>\n<p>Good SEO costs money, and businesses generally find that it\u2019s well spent. Clients that pay over $500 per month for SEO are <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/seo-services-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">53.3%<\/a> more likely to be \u201cextremely satisfied\u201d compared to those that spend less than $500 per month.<\/p>\n<p>Looking at the pros and cons of GoDaddy listed above, the items in the \u201cpros\u201d column are basic and will be provided by any SEO service. Meanwhile, some of GoDaddy\u2019s SEO practices are worse than ineffective.<\/p>\n<p>Low-quality links and thin content will get you demoted in the search rankings. GoDaddy SEO is a waste of money if it actually harms your SEO efforts.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15339\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/what-are-bad-links.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"517\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/what-are-bad-links.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/what-are-bad-links-603x500.png 603w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/what-are-bad-links-483x400.png 483w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/prowly.com\/magazine\/stop-spam-backlinks-ruining-google-reputation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_to_use_instead_of_GoDaddy_SEO\">What to use instead of GoDaddy SEO<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>GoDaddy\u2019s core offerings are hosting services and registration of domain names.

This is the option that gets you the most SEO expertise for the best price.<\/p>\n<p>A good SEO agency:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stays current with changes to Google\u2019s algorithm and SEO techniques<\/li>\n<li>Provides multiple types of SEO: onpage optimization, link building, technical SEO, content development, and local SEO<\/li>\n<li>Communicated about what it\u2019s doing and provides regular reports<\/li>\n<li>Has a good reputation and good reviews<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For a real-life example of what an SEO agency can do, let\u2019s look at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/case-study\/smartbox\/\">SmartBox<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>SmartBox came to HigherVisibility when they were looking for help with a rebranding and hoping to grow their organic traffic.<\/p>\n<p>HigherVisibility started by performing individualized competitive research in the storage and moving space to identify short- and long-term opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>We performed a continuous technical audit of SmartBox\u2019s website to identify any issues that might affect rank. We also audited the site\u2019s backlink profile to check that it was sound and that there were no quality links being disavowed.<\/p>\n<p>The team researched backlink opportunities and reached out to prospects. These opportunities aren\u2019t just sites where anyone can post content \u2014 it\u2019s based on competitor research, finding previously unlinked mentions of the brand, resource-driven outreach, and more.<\/p>\n<p>HigherVisibility also found that SmartBox was suffering from low-quality content. We worked to prune any content that no longer added value and rewrote other content to better match the user intent of different pages.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll notice that most of what the agency did goes beyond GoDaddy\u2019s scope. And it paid off. In the end, HigherVisibility increased organic traffic for Smartbox by 155.95% conversions by 210.22%.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15336\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/smartbox.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/smartbox.png 525w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/smartbox-494x400.png 494w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/case-study\/smartbox\/\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_Conclusion\">In Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>GoDaddy\u2019s SEO service is a tempting choice due to low costs.
