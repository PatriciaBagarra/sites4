Could providing content for other people\u2019s websites really help yours?<\/p>\n<p>Absolutely.<\/p>\n<p>Guest posting is one of the best ways to extend your brand reach and get more eyes on your website.<\/p>\n<p>But how?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s what we\u2019re going to be discussing in this article. We will talk about the what, the where, and the how of guest posting in 2020.<\/p>\n<h2>What is Guest Posting and How Does it Help SEO?<\/h2>\n<p>Before you can understand how guest posting can help your business establish a foothold in the search engine world, you first have to understand what guest posting is.<\/p>\n<p>Guest posting is the process of writing and publishing a blog article on someone else\u2019s website.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13758\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-blogging.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"586\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-blogging.png 586w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-blogging-520x500.png 520w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-blogging-416x400.png 416w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 586px) 100vw, 586px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/blog\/tabid\/6307\/bid\/31833\/17-foolish-mistakes-to-avoid-as-a-guest-blogger.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, websites don\u2019t want you to submit a full article. That actually makes your job a lot easier. All you have to do is create a short pitch for the article you want to submit. The site can then either accept the pitch or pass on it. This is the most convenient method of pitching a guest post because you don\u2019t actually have to write out a full article in advance.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, you shouldn\u2019t be pitching the same article to every website. What if more than one of them want it? No one wants to publish an article that users can find elsewhere. That\u2019s why every pitch should be tailor made for the site you\u2019re submitting to. If that site passes on the article and you think it could be a solid fit for another platform, feel free to pitch it in a way that makes sense for that particular site.<\/p>\n<p>Guest posting represents a great opportunity for advanced networking with some of the serious movers and shakers in your industry. You should consider your guest post to be a foot in the door; a handshake that starts off what could turn into a beneficial business relationship.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, when a business agrees to publish your article, they\u2019re doing more than just listing you on their site. Pushing out your content is essentially a seal of approval. It\u2019s an established presence in the industry vouching for your expertise. That can go a long way in convincing prospects that you\u2019re the real deal.<\/p>\n<p>You should also consider this to be an opportunity to impress those same people with your knowledge and expertise. One of the best ways to show off your acumen is through a blog article. It\u2019s a perfect vehicle to showcase why you should be taken seriously. This can improve your standing in the industry and it can make a great impression on potential customers. It\u2019s a win-win.<\/p>\n<p>Now, this next part is really important.<\/p>\n<p>All guest blog articles should contain a link back to your site. That\u2019s the ultimate goal of all guest posts. All websites should allow this. They understand <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/what-is-seo\/\">how SEO works<\/a> and if they refuse to let you include a link, then that might not be a great site for you to post on.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/link-building\/\">Link building<\/a> is essential for SEO success. It is one of the most important aspects of modern <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO services<\/a>. It\u2019s also one of the hardest SEO steps to succeed in.<\/p>\n<p>You want a portfolio of high-profile and relevant backlinks. A backlink is when another site links to you.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A link is actually more important than a plain article. While the article might impress customers, links impress Google. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google wants to know that it is recommending quality content from industry experts to searchers. One of the best ways to see who the industry experts are is by examining the number of sites that are linking to a page. A link is like a letter of recommendation from the sites that agree to let you post.<\/p>\n<p>When you write a guest post with a link back to your site, technically you\u2019re the one linking back to yourself. However, that\u2019s a matter of semantics. As long as the link appears on another site, that site is linking to you.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re linking to your site in a guest post, there\u2019s some strategy involved. You don\u2019t want to jam your links down the reader\u2019s throat. They should be casually placed within the content, so they don&#8217;t out as a self-aggrandizing link.<\/p>\n<p>By guest posting, you can solve one of the most important questions that SEO newbies struggle with.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cHow the heck am I going to get backlinks?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Guest posting works a lot better than simply asking another site to link to you. Typically, the site wants something out of the exchange. Providing them with quality content for their users to enjoy is a perfect linking opportunity.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not just an educated guess. There are tangible examples of guest posting success that we can point at to prove this.<\/p>\n<p>Take the story of Gregory Ciotti, for example. His blog, HelpScout, provides content marketing insight to businesses. It has become a popular platform and a lot of that has to do with guest blogging.<\/p>\n<p>Ciotti used his role as a guest blogger to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gregoryciotti.com\/guest-blogging\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">generate 36,733 new email subscribers<\/a>. That\u2019s a massive number that can\u2019t be overlooked.<\/p>\n<p>Guest blogging has a proven track record of success. If it could work for one person, why not you?<\/p>\n<h2>Where to Find Guest Posting Opportunities<\/h2>\n<p>Now that you know what guest blogging is and what it can do for your business, it\u2019s time to start seeking out posting opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t just submit everywhere and expect to see results. Your opportunities have to be targeted. If you\u2019re a carpenter and you\u2019re get a guest post listed on a dental website, that\u2019s not going to do anything for you.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because Google takes relevancy into account.<\/p>\n<p>When SEO was new, a lot of companies jumped on board in an attempt to game the system using tactics that came to be known as black hat SEO. One of the most common black hat tactics was to create dummy websites that contained nothing but a link back to the site they were trying to rank for.<\/p>\n<p>The sad thing about this tactic is that, for a while, it worked marvelously. Google was not the advanced algorithm-driven powerhouse that it is today, and it was fooled by the simple misdirection.<\/p>\n<p>But those days are long since over.<\/p>\n<p>Google understands black hat tactics, and has changed its algorithm to specifically combat them. As such, not only do your linking sites have to be real, they also have to be relevant to your industry. Google won\u2019t care what a dentist has to say about carpentry.<\/p>\n<p>A good bet would be to try and find an industry resource page that draws from a similar audience.<\/p>\n<p>It should also be a site that is somewhat well known and popular. When Google already trusts a site and recommends it via its search engine, a link from that site goes farther than a link from a new site without much domain authority.<\/p>\n<p>Apart from the SEO advantages, you want to make sure that the posts you\u2019re writing are being seen, so shoot for websites that have a high readership.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13759\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-blog-feedback.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-blog-feedback.png 680w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-blog-feedback-75x43.png 75w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are other factors that can help make a website a perfect fit for a guest blog: Check to see if the site owner has an active social media presence on popular platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. If they\u2019re regularly posting new website content along social channels, it stands to reason that they will push your content as well.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best ways to find sites that are Google approved is to perform a Google search and start combing through the results.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure that you\u2019re using a keyword that is consistent with your industry. If you\u2019re a plumber try typing in \u201cplumbing blog\u201d or \u201cplumbing questions.\u201d Then, to make sure you\u2019re seeing sites that are interested in posting content, use search modifiers like \u201cguest post\u201d or \u201csubmit a guest post\u201d to get the best results.<\/p>\n<p>When you perform a search like this, you will usually be taken to a guidelines page or a submission page. We will go more into the specific importance of each site\u2019s submission guidelines in the next section, but make sure you read them in their entirety.<\/p>\n<p>Another good way to find sites that are looking for guest bloggers is to figure out who your competitors are posting with. You can try analyzing competitor backlinks to determine what pages are linking to them. There are specific online tools that let you see who is linking to a competitor site. If they\u2019re posting blogs for your competition, it stands to reason that they are open to receiving content.<\/p>\n<p>Most sites aren\u2019t going to care that you\u2019re a competitor of one of their guest bloggers. They\u2019re looking for as much quality content as they can get. Use that to your advantage as you build up your portfolio.<\/p>\n<p>You could also look through social media platforms to find other guest posters and see where they are getting published. One of the best ways to scour social media for opportunities is to perform a search on Twitter for guest posts that are in line with your industry.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s one thing you need to remember regarding finding guest posting opportunities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You need to find them yourself. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t just decide that you\u2019re going to guest post and expect a rush of sites to come banging down your door begging you for content.<\/p>\n<p>The truth of it is, guest blogging works and a lot of people know that. As such, sites get inundated with requests for posts. A lot of them close their submissions regularly. That\u2019s why you need to find some regular outlets. Put yourself out there and pitch!<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13760\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-post-pitches-received-average.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"984\" height=\"836\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-post-pitches-received-average.png 984w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-post-pitches-received-average-589x500.png 589w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-post-pitches-received-average-471x400.png 471w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-post-pitches-received-average-768x652.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/referralrock.com\/blog\/guest-blogging-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Pitch opportunities can be found anywhere. Be on the lookout for guest posts from other authors, specific advertisements looking for guest posts, or try establishing a social media rapport with a business by retweeting them or mentioning them on your profile. Once a conversation begins, you can ask them if they\u2019re looking for any guest posts.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, most bloggers are writing between one and five guests posts every month, and they get these opportunities by seeking them out.<\/p>\n<p>How to Pitch a Guest Post<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve determined which sites will be a good fit for your guest posting efforts, you\u2019ll have to devise a pitch strategy.<\/p>\n<p>I wish I could say that there was one definitive, can\u2019t-miss strategy for pitching guest blogs to every site you could encounter.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t one. This is not a one-size-fits-all approach. Different websites want different things, and you can\u2019t depend on an old reliable pitch to get you onto every publication.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13761\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-poster-survey.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1310\" height=\"688\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-poster-survey.png 1310w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-poster-survey-770x404.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-poster-survey-762x400.png 762w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/guest-poster-survey-768x403.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1310px) 100vw, 1310px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/referralrock.com\/blog\/guest-blogging-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Think of article pitching as you would applying for a job. You wouldn\u2019t just throw the same cover letter out at every listing. You would personalize every cover letter to the position and the company you\u2019re applying for.<\/p>\n<p>The same can be said of pitching websites for guest posts. Your pitch should differ for every platform that you\u2019re submitting to. You\u2019ll want to tailor every email to the specific person in charge of managing the blog.<\/p>\n<p>Never start an email with something generic like \u201cDear Sir or Madam,\u201d or \u201cTo Whom it May Concern.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Remember, these people get a ton of guest blog requests. If they think you\u2019re sending them a form pitch that\u2019s going out to every site in the industry, you\u2019ll be deleted and spam filtered instantly.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to take your time when submitting articles. It may be time consuming, but you&#8217;ll get far more replies with &#8220;Sure, send us a draft this week!&#8221; if you put in the work beforehand.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing you should do is figure out who is in charge of the blog you&#8217;re targeting. You need to know who you\u2019re speaking to. If you take the time to address the person specifically, you will have a leg up on all the \u201cSir or Madam\u201d people out there.<\/p>\n<p>Next, poke around on their site and ask yourself, \u201cwhat kind of audience does this site cater to?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That will help you determine the expertise level you should be writing at. If the typical audience for a blog is industry experts, you don\u2019t want to bore them by dumbing everything down. If it\u2019s an informational site that is specifically designed for newcomers, you don\u2019t want to submit an article that will confuse them with a lot of industry jargon.<\/p>\n<p>Take some time to read through a lot of the content that\u2019s already on the site. You should be trying to blend in with the type of content that they typically post. Look at what the other guest bloggers are doing and try to come up with a similar format. If they\u2019re publishing this content, they must like something about it.<\/p>\n<p>In your research, you should try to figure out which blog posts are their most popular. You can do this using online services like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">SEMRush.com<\/a> that will help you see how many times a blog post has been tweeted out.<\/p>\n<p>Perhaps the most important aspect of article pitching is to make sure that you have fully read the guest post submission guidelines before reaching out. There is nothing that will stop you dead in your tracks faster than failing to meet the guidelines that these sites set up.<\/p>\n<p>When a blog manager receives a pitch that flies in the face of their guidelines, they immediately think that it was sent in by someone who doesn\u2019t care and is just pitching randomly to hundreds of different sites in the hope that something sticks.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Don\u2019t be that person.\u00a0 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One of the main things to look for is whether or not they want you to submit a full article or just an idea.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re not sure, err on the side of caution. My recommendation would actually to be to send a pitch (or a few article ideas) to see if they resonate with the blog&#8217;s editor. Not only does this increase your chances that one idea will stick, it shows that you&#8217;re writing specifically for their blog (original content), which is more appealing than a post which no other publication has wanted.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure to give some background information on yourself as well during the pitch. Let the blog manager know why they should be willing to accept your article. If you have any writing accolades, list them at the end of your pitch.<\/p>\n<p>Talk about the subject matter and let them know all about your level of expertise. You\u2019re not just pitching an article; you\u2019re pitching yourself.<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Guest blogging is one of the best and easiest ways to generate backlinks and boost your SEO presence. Before you can start posting, though, you need to understand the concept.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, site owners receive requests for guest posting on a daily basis. If you\u2019re not personalizing the request or following their guidelines, your email will be deleted and you will be forgotten.<\/p>\n<p>Take the time to craft the perfect pitch for every guest blogging opportunity. Put time and effort into the post, but also put careful attention into the pitch. That\u2019s the best way to succeed at guest posting in 2020.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In the SEO world, you hear a lot of talk about guest posting as a way to improve your rankings..
