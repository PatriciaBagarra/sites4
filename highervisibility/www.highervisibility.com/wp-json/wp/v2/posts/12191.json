According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.emarketer.com\/Article\/Social-Media-Marketers-Facebook-Produces-Best-ROI\/1013918\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eMarketer<\/a>, Facebook is considered the most effective social media advertising outlet by 96 percent of social media marketers.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, there are many stories that show results of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/business\/success\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">five times more traffic for both B2B and B2C companies<\/a>. It&#8217;s never too late to learn more about the right Facebook advertising tools to improve your sales and ROI in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, spending thousands of dollars on advertising only works if you know what you are doing. The good news is there are many effective tools available, and some start for as little as $5.<\/p>\n<p>While anyone can create a Facebook business page, and attain a following, it&#8217;s important to do it right. So, you must learn how to use several tools to ensure you get the best bang for your buck. You&#8217;ll also need to manage your campaigns, know what content to publish and when, as well as track your analytics.<\/p>\n<p>Are you ready to give your sales and ROI a boost this year? Keep reading to learn more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why you should advertise on Facebook in 2018<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Since Facebook is one of the biggest social media platforms in the world, you can&#8217;t afford to disregard its potential. Since Facebook attracts billions of monthly users, it is the perfect space for marketing and selling your products and services.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re one of the 27 million small businesses in the U.S., you probably don&#8217;t have an arsenal of cash lying around to spend on advertising&#8211;this means you have to make every dollar count.<\/p>\n<p>How can you effectively market your business when you&#8217;re already tight on funds? This is just one question businesses ask on a daily basis. Of course, you&#8217;re probably already aware of the advantages of connecting with your audience on social media.<\/p>\n<p>Nonetheless, it costs money to get views. And, with Facebook, you can get insanely detailed with your targeting with demographics such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Job title<\/li>\n<li>Marital status<\/li>\n<li>Age<\/li>\n<li>Religion<\/li>\n<li>Interests<\/li>\n<li>Politics<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>To illustrate, if you wanted to market to 35-year-old single women, who live in Nashville, graduated from UNC, work at a production company, vote Independent and love the Star Wars movies, you can. The best part is it takes less than $10 to start.<\/p>\n<p>You can then use one, or several, of the tools below to measure Social ROI metrics including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reach<\/li>\n<li>Likes<\/li>\n<li>Comments<\/li>\n<li>Shares<\/li>\n<li>Click-through-rate<\/li>\n<li>Page likes<\/li>\n<li>Reach<\/li>\n<li>Impressions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Facebook wants to ensure their users only view relevant content and ads. Yet, this is used to your advantage. For example, someone might be searching for real estate in Nashville and be served an ad for properties within that area.<\/p>\n<p>But, later, the person changes his or her mind and starts searching for trips to Knoxville. Facebook will respond to that change of inquiry and respond with an ad for a hotel in Knoxville. So, Facebook enables advertisers to reach people with the right message, at the right time.<\/p>\n<p>With real-time analytics, you can see exactly how well your Facebook ads are performing. And, if they aren&#8217;t performing as well as you would like, you can use insights to adjust your ads as you see fit.

If you want your ads to become highly relevant, then it is important to personalize them based on segments of your target audience.

Yet, that is only half of the battle. The other half can be accomplished through retargeting your Facebook ads&#8211;this lets you show relevant ads to your target audience once they have entered your website.<\/p>\n<p>This is especially helpful for prospects who don&#8217;t convert right away. Of course, your ads must be tailored to fit the needs of your target audience. Since people are so busy, your ads may not get as many clicks as you would like.<\/p>\n<p>They might open your ad, go to your site, then go back to Facebook. Instead, retargeting helps to remind them of your promotions while they are browsing through their newsfeed.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, you really need to show your marketing messages multiple times before a prospect is ready to convert. There must be a frequency to your Facebook ads.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, retargeting can help make your business look larger than it really is. When your ads are everywhere, consumers start to think that you must have a huge company. Retargeting also helps to build trust since your company will never be forgotten.<\/p>\n<p>Retargeting lets you market to an audience who have already interacted with your brand such as those who have:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visited your website<\/li>\n<li>Purchased on your website<\/li>\n<li>Subscribed to your email list<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Just by &#8220;being there,&#8221; your prospects will start to familiarize themselves and trust your brand. They see your ads on their newsfeed daily so, you start to become like a familiar friend. This is what AdRoll can do for your Facebook ads.<\/p>\n<p>AdRoll offers built-in contextual, behavioral and site retargeting. Their interface is user friendly with visual conversion tracking.
