But Google is the big dog in the search engine yard.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Google isn\u2019t your friend if you\u2019re not at the top of the search results. The first result for a keyword typically has a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/google-first-page-clicks\/374516\/#close\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">28.5%<\/a> click-through rate. Meanwhile, fewer than <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-ctr-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">1%<\/a> of searchers click a result on the second page.

Those keywords should be chosen carefully, with market research.<\/p>\n<p>You have to know what your audience is looking for, how those terms are relevant to your business, and the frequency that they are searched for.<\/p>\n<p>Keywords should also be added to image titles and alt text.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because Google\u2019s search bots can\u2019t see images. They know that the image is there \u2014\u00a0 they just don\u2019t know what it is. If you have a photo of a sailboat on the page, it doesn\u2019t know that it\u2019s a sailboat.<\/p>\n<p>But if you use a keyword to specify that it\u2019s a sailboat in the image title and alt tag, you\u2019ve successfully informed Google and helped it to index your site\u2019s multimedia content.<\/p>\n<p>You also have to crosslink between your pages, ensuring that your articles all connect to one another. This network of internal links helps distribute authority and ranking power throughout your website.<\/p>\n<p>For SEO to work, your content should be updated regularly to keep up with search engine algorithms. Google is constantly changing its ranking factors, so it\u2019s important to stay on top of it.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"WORK_WITH_THE_2020_SEO_AGENCY_OF_THE_YEAR\">WORK WITH THE 2020 SEO AGENCY OF THE YEAR<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped hundreds of businesses generate more online leads and sales through SEO.

Fixed-price contract<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This SEO pricing model lets clients pay for the services that they want specifically. This can go beyond what is listed here and differs agency by agency.<\/p>\n<p>When working on a fixed-price contract, SEO Copywriting, a form of content marketing, will run from 15 cents to 50 cents per word. The site SEO audit, which examines your conversion rate, among other things, might cost between $500 and $7,500, depending on the size of the site.<\/p>\n<p>Link profile audits, which gauge the level of backlink building that has to be done, can run you from $500 to $7,500. For social media setup, you\u2019re looking at $500 to $3,000.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"3_Project-based_pricing\">3. Project-based pricing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Project-based pricing is one of the most straightforward contracts you can enter with an SEO firm. Essentially, you\u2019re paying a predetermined fee for ongoing custom services.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on the level of service you\u2019re asking for, expect to pay anywhere between $1,000 and $30,000 for the full project. At the end of the contract term, you can renegotiate.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"4_Hourly_rate\">4. Hourly rate<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Hourly rates are considered consultation fees. Much like working with an attorney, the firm will keep a running log of the hours that they spend working on your SEO strategy.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not uncommon to see hourly pricing from $100 to $300 per hour.<\/p>\n<p>While there\u2019s a lot of variety in the prices we\u2019ve listed above, it\u2019s important to remember that SEO packages charging less than $750 per month should make you wary.<\/p>\n<p>Another important fact to remember: search engine optimization takes time. It\u2019s not an instant thing. Sometimes it can take up to six months before you start to see a return on your investment.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_factors_affect_the_cost_of_SEO_services\">What factors affect the cost of SEO services?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The price of SEO services for your organization will be determined by a combination of factors.<\/p>\n<p>First, successful and experienced SEO agencies can charge more. The average SEO specialist who has been in the business for less than two years charges <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/seo-pricing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$79.37<\/a> per hour. That jumps to $142.50 for those with over ten years in the search engine optimization business.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15484\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Picture7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Picture7.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/Picture7-600x400.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/seo-pricing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It can be worth it to pay for the expertise of an established company, but make sure they have something to show for all that time in the industry. A successful SEO agency should be able to show you case studies with real numbers.<\/p>\n<p>A good SEO firm will also have built a reputation. Look at reviews or seek out industry award winners.<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, when you first sign on with an agency, they\u2019ll often start by conducting an SEO audit to evaluate the current state of your website. The more work it needs, the more you\u2019ll pay.<\/p>\n<p>The scope of the SEO project also matters. Does your website have thousands of pages (common for ecommerce sites) or just a few? How much new content do you want to create?<\/p>\n<p>Your search engine optimization rates will depend on which types of SEO you need. If you\u2019re only looking for on-page optimization, your SEO package will probably be cheaper than one that includes technical SEO and link building as well.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, your industry and the strength of your competition affect SEO pricing. A competitive landscape means your SEO project will be bigger in scope and more time-consuming.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_conclusion\">In conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When it\u2019s time to write a check for your SEO services, it\u2019s important to remember that you\u2019re making an investment that could shape the future of your entire company.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why, before you make that first payment, you should have a strong understanding of SEO pricing models as well as why you need it.<\/p>\n<p>You should also be able to identify the various ways that most agencies price these services and be wary of anyone trying to set SEO pricing at less than $750 per month.<\/p>\n<p>By keeping all of this information at the forefront of your mind, you will be able to make an educated SEO budget and ensure that your search engine optimization campaign will be profitable for the long haul.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"WORK_WITH_THE_2020_SEO_AGENCY_OF_THE_YEAR-3\">WORK WITH THE 2020 SEO AGENCY OF THE YEAR<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped hundreds of businesses generate more online leads and sales through SEO.
