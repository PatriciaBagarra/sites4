Companies can no longer get away scot-free when doing something bad.<\/p>\n<p>But at the same time, there\u2019s a new opportunity in the marketing game.

The tweets resonated with Americans who had strong feelings about what happened, and got retweeted over 109,000 times.<\/p>\n<p>Getting almost 500,000 likes on a corporate Twitter account with regular promotional content is nearly <em>impossible<\/em>, even with an <em>unlimited <\/em>budget.
