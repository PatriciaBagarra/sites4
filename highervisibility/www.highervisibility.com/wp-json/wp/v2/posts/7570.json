Most ideas and tips are good for any website, others may be better fit for e-commerce sites, and sometimes you have to slightly revise tactics to make them work for you. In other words, if you are an e-commerce website then that doesn\u2019t mean that interactive websites won\u2019t work for you. It\u2019s all about being creative and knowing where to start.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Top_10_Ways_to_Create_a_More_Interactive_Website_for_Your_E-commerce_Store\"><strong>Top 10 Ways to Create a More Interactive Website for Your E-commerce Store<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Below are ten different ways to make your site more interactive and then what you can do to make it work for an e-commerce website:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"Polls\"><strong>Polls<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>One way to reach out to your audience and make their experience more interactive is by including a poll on your website. There are several free poll applications available, so this is an improvement that won\u2019t cost you anything but will allow you to gain instant feedback from your user base.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A How To for E-commerce:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are so many ways you can use polls for an e-commerce site. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ecommerce-guide.com\/article.php\/3912381\/7-Tips-to-Create-Useful-Ecommerce-Surveys-and-Polls.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">One popular way<\/a> is to use them as a short customer satisfaction survey. People like being asked for their feedback, and this is a good way to check-in to see how you are doing as an online merchant.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"Surveys\"><strong>Surveys<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Polls can be used for gaining quick insight and information, as we just discussed, however if you want to get more information from your website users and clients, surveys can be one way to take that on. The nature of getting this much feedback in one session is interactive in-it-of itself. You don\u2019t have to make a survey extremely long, and they can vary quite a bit in size and form.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A How To for E-commerce:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>E-commerce sites frequently use surveys to collect information. Think about using a survey via email to have users report back on their purchasing experience, or their overall experience on your website.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"Personalization\"><strong>Personalization <\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Personalization is a fairly new concept in website development. There is a great article by OHO <a href=\"https:\/\/www.oho.com\/blog\/explained-60-seconds-real-time-website-personalization\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Explained in 60 Seconds: Real-Time Website Personalization<\/a> where they do a great job of capturing the most important features of why personalizing your website experience to each individual user can be so beneficial, and some tools with helping you add this feature to your site.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A How To for E-commerce:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Not all shoppers are alike in what they are after. By personalizing features (again, read the article I mentioned above for the full scoop) there are so many possibilities for how you can target specific clients. For example, you can personalize shopping experience by explicit data, such as age, gender, interests, or other information about a specific user that they have entered into their online profile.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"Gifs\"><strong>Gifs<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Animated Gifs are often enjoyable for users, light-hearted, and interactive. For a list of the top 10 sites where you can get animated Gifs for your website click here.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A How To for E-commerce:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>So how can you use a Gif? To be totally honest, using Gifs on your e-commerce site is really going to depend on what type of site you have. You can use them in a lighthearted humorous way, or simply as an animated image to help you tell more about your products or services. My tip here is to make sure that it is relevant and doesn\u2019t look totally out of the blue. They can be used in really creative awesome ways, so long as you do not take them overboard.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"Your_Blog\"><strong>Your Blog<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>One thing is for sure, you should have a blog, and you should be using it to your advantage. There is a lot of information available for how to make your blog the best it can be, so post frequently, and post content that your users will enjoy and relate to. This will help urge people to comment; thus adding an interactive element.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A How To for E-commerce:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For e-commerce sites, a blog can definitely be a key component to making your site\u2019s experience more interactive. Here are three ideas you can use to make your blog posts more interactive for users:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Add social media buttons for Twitter or Facebook so that users can share your post immediately.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure you add a \u201csee also\u201d section for other content you have produced that may be valuable to them based on their interests.<\/li>\n<li>Add video and photo media to make your content more interesting. This also makes users want to interact with the content and share more frequently.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"Live_Chat_Customer_Service\"><strong>Live Chat &amp; Customer Service <\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Users like when they can get help and answers instantly. Depending on the size of your company, and what you are capable of handling in terms of website customer service, this may actually end up varying greatly. If it is at all possible, add a live chat\/customer service feature to your website (at least during normal business hours).<\/p>\n<p><strong>A How To for E-commerce:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>On an e-commerce site, having this feature is definitely a bonus. If people are struggling with the check out process or have a question about a product, this may be the defining aspect that makes the sale! If possible, make this component for interaction available, and add a call-to-action button for easy utilization.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"E-Newsletter\"><strong>E-Newsletter<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Newsletters are a great way to increase interaction with your site. By sending out a monthly message with new features, you are going to increase visits and overall interest with your company.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A How To for E-commerce:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Write a monthly newsletter that is subscribed to via-email, for you to update clients about new products or services, sales, and any new information that you think can be valuable to them.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"Podcast\"><strong>Podcast <\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Podcasts are definitely an interactive idea that not enough people are taking advantage of. They are fairly easy to set-up on your website, and people do generally enjoy getting information that way. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.makeuseof.com\/tag\/guide-setting-podcast-website-feed-wordpress-podpress\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">This site<\/a> has a ton of great information about podcasts including how to set up and create your own.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A How To for E-commerce:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is of course going to depend on the type of e-commerce site you are, but consider offering additional information on your products or services or discussing certain aspects related to what you offer as a business. For example, let\u2019s say that you are a high-fashion clothing retailer. You could offer a podcast on how to recreate certain looks from a recent fashion exhibit using the products available on your site, or a discussion of the event itself.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"E-Books\"><strong>E-Books<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Offering an e-book for download on your site is definitely one way to win people over. It instantly makes people feel like they are getting something out of visiting your site and like they are benefiting from interacting with your site.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A How To for E-commerce:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>One way to compile an e-book is to look over the content you have already created for your e-commerce site and blog. What have people benefited from the most? How can you build on some of the gaps in your material? If people take interest in your products or services, it is almost guaranteed that they would benefit from additional, downloadable content.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"User_Generated_Content\"><strong>User Generated Content <\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is definitely not the last way that you can make your site more interactive, but it is the way we will wrap up this particular post. Allowing users to generate content on your site, such as discussion forums, can be a great way to increase interaction.<\/p>\n<p><strong>A How To for E-commerce:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There are several examples of ways to allow user generated content on an e-commerce site. Disscussion forums were already mentioned, so let\u2019s take another example: Hosting webinar forums is a great way to provide information to your users, and also allow them to produce content and share ideas with your staff and other members of the community.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Takeaway\"><strong>The Takeaway <\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are so many ways to make your site more interactive. Take it as an opportunity to benefit the experience of your community and increase visits to your site.
