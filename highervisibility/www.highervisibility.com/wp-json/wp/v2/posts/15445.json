And we understand why.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike with paid ads, there\u2019s no easy, platform-specific performance dashboard that compares daily spend with sales revenue from conversions.<\/p>\n<p>The industry is full of jargon, and it can feel like some service providers are positioning themselves as gurus more than serious businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Some cynics simply conclude that SEO won\u2019t work for them.<\/p>\n<p>But the cold, hard data shows a different story. Let\u2019s see what the numbers say about whether SEO is worth it in 2021.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_expensive_is_SEO\">How expensive is SEO?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While an often-cited study (9-years old) puts the average monthly SEO spend at <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/seo-pricing-costs-of-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$5,000<\/a> per month, with more freelancers and agencies in the industry than ever, prices have changed.<\/p>\n<p>A recent study by SEO tool provider Ahrefs explored what the current pricing landscape looks like \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/seo-pricing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">74.71%<\/a> of SEO agencies and freelance consultants offer a monthly retainer.<\/p>\n<p>Surprisingly, the majority of monthly plans are cheaper than they were just nine short years ago.<\/p>\n<p><strong> <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15451\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/seos-charge.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"416\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/seos-charge.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/seos-charge-600x400.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/seo-pricing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You can also see that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/seo-pricing\/\">prices vary from SEO<\/a> company to company to a degree where averages aren\u2019t very informative.<\/p>\n<p>The influx in lower monthly fees likely reflects that more <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/what-do-small-businesses-know-about-seo\/\">small businesses invest in a basic SEO<\/a> service than ever before.<\/p>\n<p>But when 56% of the SEOs charge more than $76 per hour, it\u2019s hard to imagine that you get a lot of work for a retainer of a few hundred dollars.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Business_size_goals_and_target_market_are_huge_pricing_factors\">Business size, goals, and target market are huge pricing factors<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Of course, you get what you pay for. So, a multinational company with hundreds of different products or services, a $100 monthly retainer \u2014 what\u2019s even in that? Web hosting? \u2014 probably won\u2019t cut it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/industries\/enterprise\/seo\/\">Enterprise SEO<\/a> is a different ballgame than small business SEO. You\u2019re competing with million-dollar budgets and have to work hard for every tiny improvement.<\/p>\n<p>We understand that the average small business marketing budget doesn\u2019t include $10,000 for SEO. But coming up with and implementing a good SEO strategy takes time and expertise.<\/p>\n<p>If you think your company will get world-class <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/what-is-seo\/\">search engine optimization<\/a> for less than your monthly Starbucks budget, you\u2019ve got another thing coming.<\/p>\n<p>If you think about SEO as an expense, a cost center, it\u2019s easy to choose the cheapest option. But really, it\u2019s one of the biggest investment opportunities for your business.<\/p>\n<p>Think about it like real estate. When opening a new store or restaurant, you\u2019d aim for areas with a lot of foot traffic.<\/p>\n<p>SEO is the same, except the people in the \u201cstreet\u201d are potential customers who are actively searching for your products and services. Getting your business in front of these people 24\/7, 365 days a year can be life-changing<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re not willing to pay, or you can\u2019t find the money, you\u2019ll have to invest a lot of your own valuable time on trial and error.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"Let_Us_Show_You_The_Power_of_SEO\">Let Us Show You The Power of SEO<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped hundreds of businesses generate more online leads and sales through SEO.

Does it even generate sales?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The short answer is SEO is very effective \u2014 not just to generate traffic but also leads and sales. Don\u2019t worry. The long answer includes research and data, not just empty statements.<\/p>\n<p>Most SEOs get too caught up in search-specific metrics like SERPs (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/seo-spiders\/\">search engine<\/a> results page), rankings, and organic traffic.<\/p>\n<p>For example, organic search gets over 20 times more clicks than any paid Google ad. (Zero-click searches are, for example, resolved by showing the information in a Wikipedia infobox or a word definition.)<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15452\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/search-ctr.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"633\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/search-ctr.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/search-ctr-493x500.png 493w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/search-ctr-394x400.png 394w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/sparktoro.com\/blog\/in-2020-two-thirds-of-google-searches-ended-without-a-click\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>That sounds like a great selling point, right? Essentially, the traffic potential is 20 times larger with SEO. And you don\u2019t have to pay for each click for the rest of your life.<\/p>\n<p>But as a business owner, you care more about your bottom line than flashy metrics. If all that traffic comes from \u201chow you can unclog your own toilet\u201d rather than \u201cplumber in San Diego,\u201d you won\u2019t get many sales.<\/p>\n<p>Search intent and keyword relevance matter.<\/p>\n<p>But don\u2019t worry. When done right, SEO attracts potential consumers at beneficial stages in the buying cycle. A true <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/how-to-hire-an-seo-expert\/\">SEO expert knows<\/a> how to plan an SEO campaign that delivers traffic, conversions, and sales.<\/p>\n<p>And the proof is in the pudding. For B2B companies, SEO generates more revenue than all other <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/digital-marketing-career-guide-how-to-get-started\/\">digital marketing<\/a> channels combined. Across all industries, it averages 44% of all revenue.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15453\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/2x-organic.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"568\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/2x-organic.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/2x-organic-549x500.png 549w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/2x-organic-439x400.png 439w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/videos.brightedge.com\/research-report\/BrightEdge_ChannelReport2019_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s something powerful about showing up naturally in the top results for Google.

For most businesses, SEO is a solid investment.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"When_will_we_see_results_SEO_takes_too_long\">When will we see results? SEO takes too long<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Some business owners and managers, especially in SMBs, feel like SEO simply takes too long.<\/p>\n<p>In our recent study on <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/small-business-digital-marketing-study\/\">SMBs and digital marketing<\/a>, almost 68.8% of SMB owners expect significant results in three months or less.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15447\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/how-long-results.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"403\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/how-long-results.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/04\/how-long-results-619x400.png 619w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Realistically, with the time it takes to rank pages in the top results, three months is at the lower end of what you could expect. And that\u2019s if you invested in professional <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO services<\/a> from experts with an appropriate budget.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t go all-in, expect a much slower timeframe.<\/p>\n<p>If you try the do-it-yourself approach, only partially outsource it, or go for the cheapest option, it\u2019s hard to tell when you should expect results. In a worst-case scenario, you may never see results or even a negative impact on your SERPs.<\/p>\n<p>Learning SEO is a painstaking process that often involves more error than trial. In your quest to conquer the number one search result spot for your keywords, it\u2019s best to get help from people who\u2019ve done it before.<\/p>\n<p>In the post \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/how-long-does-seo-take\/\">how long does SEO take<\/a>,\u201d we cover this in more detail, including steps you can take to get results faster.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"Let_Us_Show_You_The_Power_of_SEO-2\">Let Us Show You The Power of SEO<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped hundreds of businesses generate more online leads and sales through SEO.

Even when someone Googles your company by name or keywords you already ranked for, you won\u2019t show up.<\/p>\n<p>It can take months and thousands of dollars to recover. Self-proclaimed experts also share these \u201ctricks\u201d online. Follow them at your own risk.<\/p>\n<p>If you want consistent, reliable results, you need to work with a reputable white hat SEO agency. Ideally, you should choose one with a reputation for being on the cutting edge of technical SEO.<\/p>\n<p>One indicator of that is that they\u2019ve recently won recognized industry awards.<\/p>\n<p>(Not to toot our own horn here, but <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/highervisibility-wins-two-seo-agency-of-the-year-awards-in-2020\/\">we won two awards<\/a> in 2020, including Search Engine Land\u2019s SEO Agency of the year)<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the awards alone don\u2019t tell the whole story. Just like you shouldn\u2019t instantly hire someone because of their diploma, you shouldn\u2019t instantly hire an agency because of their awards.<\/p>\n<p>You also want to see case studies of real companies (like the one we shared above) with live websites where you can double-check the claimed results.<\/p>\n<p>You should also check a firm\u2019s customer reputation, for example, with <a href=\"https:\/\/clutch.co\/profile\/highervisibility\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clutch.co<\/a>.
