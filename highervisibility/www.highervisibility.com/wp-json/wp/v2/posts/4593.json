It\u2019s something easy to use, so the question isn\u2019t so much about how to make it happen, but whether or not it\u2019s something that works for you specifically. It\u2019s about understanding what it is, why it matters, and whether or not it\u2019s something that should be brought into your 2014 strategy.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"MOST_COMPANIES_STRUGGLE_WITH_GENERATING_Positive_ROI_Using_Google_AdsWE_FIX_THAT\">MOST COMPANIES STRUGGLE WITH GENERATING Positive ROI Using Google Ads...WE FIX THAT!<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many businesses grow strategically through PPC.

From Google AdWords you can buy clicks through the Search Partners network, and then your ads will appear on these pages that are a part of the network. Some of these pages include:<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Google search sites such as Google Shopping, Maps, Images, and Groups.<\/li>\n<li>Site directory pages.<\/li>\n<li>Search results pages.<\/li>\n<li>Internal search results and product pages on sites like eBay, Amazon, Walmart, Target.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/div>\n<p>When working with AdWords, you can choose not to include search partners by unclicking the button that says \u201cinclude search partners\u201d that you find on your campaign settings page, which is shown below:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-4594\" src=\"\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/partners.png\" alt=\"partners\" width=\"615\" height=\"75\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/partners.png 975w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/partners-770x93.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/01\/partners-768x93.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>According to Paid Search\/Display Account Manager at Hanapin Marketing Sam Owen in his Search Engine land <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/how-to-understand-and-optimize-adwords-search-partners-data-180538\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">article<\/a>, it\u2019s a good idea to use the segment button in your \u201call campaigns\u201d menu and then segment by \u201cNetwork (with search partners)\u201d to see if it\u2019s a worthwhile feature for you to use. Ask yourself a few questions:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><i>Is your account on a tight budget?<\/i> If so, it might be a good idea to turn them off because they often have a higher cost per conversion.<\/li>\n<li><i>Are you getting at least 20 percent more clicks with Search Partners?<\/i> This is a good number; so if you have enough data to make an analysis, use this as a benchmark.<\/li>\n<li><i>Are Search Partners underperforming on only certain campaigns?<\/i> If yes, you can go back and pause your Search Partners by going to your settings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Optimizing your campaigns for Search Partners is tough and many (including Owen) agree that it might be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Bing makes it easy to optimize because you can setup Search Partner-only campaigns and even section off your campaign to certain search partners, so you may want to try and use that data to help you understand how it\u2019s working on your Google campaigns (flashbacks to advice about the encrypted data <a href=\"http:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2013\/11\/07\/not-provided-keyword-data\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">announcement<\/a>, anyone?).<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"MOST_COMPANIES_STRUGGLE_WITH_GENERATING_Positive_ROI_Using_Google_AdsWE_FIX_THAT-2\">MOST COMPANIES STRUGGLE WITH GENERATING Positive ROI Using Google Ads...WE FIX THAT!<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many businesses grow strategically through PPC.

You\u2019ll see negatives to Search Parnters all over the Internet, so it\u2019s tough to know what to believe. People disagree with Search Partners because sites where consumers filter down through categories to come up with a search are included. In other words, Search Partners counts clicks for those who didn\u2019t type in a search directly. When this happens you will see your number of clicks skyrocket (along with your bill) while not seeing many more sales.<\/p>\n<p>Founder of Richman SEO Training Danny Richman posted about this on <a href=\"http:\/\/moz.com\/ugc\/how-googles-search-partner-network-could-be-damaging-your-roi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Moz<\/a> where he explains that Google needs to make advertisers more aware. A slew of comments shows that he wasn\u2019t the only one dealing with this huge negative, not to mention it\u2019s proof that Search Partners, no matter how long they\u2019ve been around, are not explained well by Google and therefore not understood well by marketers.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Verdict_Is_Search_Partners_Worth_it_for_Your_AdWords_Campaigns_This_Year\"><b>The Verdict: Is Search Partners Worth it for Your AdWords Campaigns This Year?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>In my opinion, they are going to be worth it for most companies because it is another way to put your ad in front of relevant users. Of course, it\u2019s always important to use your own data and analysis to make sure it is working for you, not to mention to be aware of some of the negatives out there surrounding this feature.<\/p>\n<p>Have you tried Search Partners in the past?
