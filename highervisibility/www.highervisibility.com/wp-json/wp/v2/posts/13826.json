Its themes and templates allow beginner web designers to create a professional-looking WordPress website without a lot of complicated code.<\/p>\n<p>And the plugins flesh out the platform in a thousand different ways.<\/p>\n<p>So you&#8217;re sold, but before we can dive into launching your website, we need to answer a simple question: <b>how do you get started using WordPress?\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Read on to find out.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_are_the_Benefits_of_Using_WordPress\"><b>What are the Benefits of Using WordPress?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Here are some of the primary benefits of using WordPress.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"WordPress_is_Good_For_All_Skill_Levels\">WordPress is Good For All Skill Levels<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>WordPress is a versatile platform that appeals to both seasoned developers and beginners alike.

WordPress owns an e-commerce plugin called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/woocommerce-seo-best-practices\/\">Woocommerce<\/a>, which is the world\u2019s most popular ecommerce system. However, there are a number of other systems that can be used on the platform, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/bigcommerce-seo-best-practices\/\">BigCommerce<\/a> or Easy Digital Downloads.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13830\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/wordpress-marketshare.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"333\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/wordpress-marketshare.png 600w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/wordpress-marketshare-75x43.png 75w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/ecommerce-platforms.com\/ecommerce-selling-advice\/this-is-you-should-use-wordpress-for-ecommerce-site\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Using WordPress, you can create a truly personalized and on-brand shopping experience for your customers.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"WordPress_is_Customizable\"><b>WordPress is Customizable<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>As a platform, WordPress can be very customizable. It can be used for something simple, like a personal blog, or a massive corporate website with an online store and multiple subdomains.<\/p>\n<p>WordPress themes are easily changed and updated because everything goes through a central WordPress dashboard. If you\u2019re an advanced web designer, you can also update your themes using HTML and CSS code languages.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"WordPress_is_Extremely_Popular\"><b>WordPress is Extremely Popular<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>All of these benefits have made WordPress incredibly popular as a website-building platform. *<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codeinwp.com\/blog\/wordpress-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">75 million sites<\/a> built on WordPress.<\/li>\n<li>WordPress powers <a href=\"https:\/\/hostingtribunal.com\/blog\/wordpress-statistics\/#gref\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">more than 34% of the internet<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>People view more than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codeinwp.com\/blog\/wordpress-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">23.6 billion WordPress pages a month<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.codeinwp.com\/blog\/wordpress-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">14.7% of the world\u2019s top 100 websites<\/a> are built on WordPress.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That means WordPress is responsible for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codeinwp.com\/blog\/wordpress-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">50-60% of the global CMS market share<\/a>, making it the most popular CMS platform by far. It\u2019s estimated that there are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.codeinwp.com\/blog\/wordpress-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">500 new sites<\/a> built on WordPress every single day.<\/p>\n<p>All this means that WordPress is the king of the website builders, and it\u2019s not going away anytime soon.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_Do_You_Start_Using_WordPress\"><b>How Do You Start Using WordPress?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If all of those benefits sound good to you, then it\u2019s time to start using WordPress to build your website. Thankfully, it\u2019s not a complicated process. WordPress is designed so that anyone can use it, regardless of skill level.<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 1: Get a hosting provider.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>You could create a self-hosted WordPress site on your own web server, but there are subscription-based services that keep your website running on the internet. Some of these are free while most are paid. If you\u2019re going to be seeing a lot of daily traffic, you\u2019ll want a paid hosting service. They\u2019re the only ones that offer the space and support needed to withstand high levels of web traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Some hosting services include <a href=\"https:\/\/in.godaddy.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">GoDaddy<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hostgator.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">HostGator<\/a>. Many hosting services even have their own website building platform built in, but few of them hold a candle to WordPress.<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 2: Choose a domain name<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>Some hosting services will give you a free domain for the first year, so it\u2019s best to do your research to find one offering a promotion that you can take advantage of.<\/p>\n<p><b>Step 3: Follow the hosting company\u2019s instructions for setup and point your domain name to the WordPress service.\u00a0<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Once that\u2019s all done, you\u2019re ready to start using WordPress.<\/p>\n<p>The next step is to choose your theme.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_are_WordPress_Themes\"><b>What are WordPress Themes?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As we briefly mentioned before, a theme is a WordPress template that provides you with a skeleton for your site. WordPress themes allow you to have a starting point from which to build the layout of your pages, and there are more than 11,000 of them to choose from.\u00a0 <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13831\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/theme-directory.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1295\" height=\"909\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/theme-directory.png 1295w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/theme-directory-712x500.png 712w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/theme-directory-570x400.png 570w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/theme-directory-768x539.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1295px) 100vw, 1295px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Are_WordPress_Themes_Free\"><b>Are WordPress Themes Free?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Many WordPress themes come at absolutely no cost. That\u2019s great news, but many free options are limited in their scope.<\/p>\n<p>All themes, both free and premium, can be found through the WordPress dashboard by clicking on \u201cAppearance,\u201d and then the tab marked, \u201cThemes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Users can also install a theme developed by a third-party if they don\u2019t want to use any WordPress themes.<\/p>\n<p>There are more than <a href=\"https:\/\/hostingtribunal.com\/blog\/wordpress-statistics\/#gref\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">3,500 free themes<\/a> for WordPress, and services like <a href=\"https:\/\/themeforest.net\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Themeforest<\/a> have more than 47,000 WordPress compatible themes to choose from.<\/p>\n<p>The majority of Themeforests&#8217;s WordPress themes are paid, and most of them start somewhere around $2, which is far cheaper than the majority of WordPress premium themes.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"What_do_WordPress_Themes_Cost\"><b>What do WordPress Themes Cost?<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The median price for most WordPress premium themes is <a href=\"https:\/\/hostingtribunal.com\/blog\/wordpress-statistics\/#gref\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$59<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Premium themes are typically better for business websites. That\u2019s because they have more features and reliability than their free counterparts.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Picking_a_WordPress_Theme\"><b>Picking a WordPress Theme<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve selected your theme, it\u2019s time to install it on the site. You should pick a theme that can be edited so that you can incorporate your branding into the look and feel of your website. If your logo colors are red and yellow and your theme only comes in black and white, that\u2019s not going to work out well.<\/p>\n<p>You should also think about your audience when selecting a theme and customize it to fit their needs. What would be aesthetically pleasing to your target demographic?<\/p>\n<p>Users can typically customize the widgets, menus, headers, and background of their WordPress theme. You can use the theme customizer tool, which appears under the \u201cAppearance\u201d tab and then beneath the \u201cThemes\u201d option:<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13832\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/picking-a-theme.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"442\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/picking-a-theme.png 602w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/picking-a-theme-545x400.png 545w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Some widgets come pre-loaded on specific themes. Regardless of whether it came as a part of your theme or you installed it yourself, these widgets can be rearranged and customized to your branding.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve got the look and feel of the site down, it\u2019s time to start figuring out what kind of plugins you\u2019re going to need.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_are_WordPress_Plugins\"><b>What are WordPress Plugins?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A WordPress plugin is an add-on for your site that enhances its functionality and user experience. <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13833\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/featured-plugins.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1319\" height=\"805\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/featured-plugins.png 1319w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/featured-plugins-770x470.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/featured-plugins-655x400.png 655w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/featured-plugins-768x469.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1319px) 100vw, 1319px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Plugins can be found in the <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress Plugin Directory<\/a>.

That\u2019s because everything springs from there. It is the most visited page on most sites and the place where you need to make a stellar first impression on your incoming users.<\/p>\n<p>A homepage design is usually included in theme templates, so it\u2019s not a page that\u2019s going to give you any major issues.<\/p>\n<p>A plugin like WordPress Page Builder or Divi could also be used for designing a custom homepage.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"About_Us_Page\"><b>About Us Page<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>When you\u2019re creating a site for a business, there should always be an \u201cAbout Us\u201d page.<\/p>\n<p>You should create an about page to inform visitors about your company. It\u2019s the place where you tell your story and try to connect with prospective customers on a personal level.<\/p>\n<p>On the about page, you should be sharing your company history. This is also a perfect place to touch on your mission statement.<\/p>\n<p>Many businesses use their about page to highlight essential team members and tell the story of their site. It\u2019s the spot where your personality can shine through, and a lot of WordPress templates have an option for it.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Contact_Page\"><b>Contact Page<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>When creating a contact page, you might want to use a plugin. This will help you create an email form that you can pop up on the site for users to fill out if they have any questions.<\/p>\n<p>These queries can then be delivered right to your email address. This is also a place to list your phone number and any other relevant contact information.<\/p>\n<p>While contact form plugins are perfect for this page, a lot of templates will also have a Contact Page option, since it\u2019s such a standard inclusion for most business websites.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Blog_Page\"><b>Blog Page<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Every website should have a blog. Blog posts are a great way to get your thoughts and expertise out there, and it\u2019s great for SEO.<\/p>\n<p>WordPress was initially designed as a blogging platform, and content is still king there. As such, most WordPress themes will have some blogging templates. Often, it\u2019s a setting on the site that you can assign to any page.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Portfolio_or_Gallery\"><b>Portfolio or Gallery<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>WordPress has a lot of great options for creating a professional portfolio or image gallery.<\/p>\n<p>A portfolio allows you to post high-quality images and display them in a variety of ways. This is another service that is included in most WordPress templates. There are also dedicated gallery plugins like Modula and Jetpack, which allow you to display your images in a variety of ways.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"E-commerce_Store\"><b>E-commerce Store\u00a0<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p>E-commerce can be a lucrative field, and WordPress has you covered, as we mentioned before. <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13827\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/ecommerce.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1236\" height=\"932\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/ecommerce.png 1236w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/ecommerce-663x500.png 663w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/ecommerce-530x400.png 530w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/ecommerce-370x280.png 370w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/ecommerce-768x579.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1236px) 100vw, 1236px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When creating your e-commerce store, regardless of the plugin selected, you\u2019re going to have to set up custom options for your products with optimized descriptions and high-quality images.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also have to set up things like taxes, payment methods, shipping, and more.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_Conclusion\"><b>In Conclusion<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s a reason why so many people use WordPress.
