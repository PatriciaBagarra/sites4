Some offer their services for as little as $5.<\/p>\n<p>But what do you get when you contract with one of these low-cost SEO firms?<\/p>\n<p>You may be better off not knowing.<\/p>\n<p>What many have found is that cheap often translates to poor quality. In the long run, this can cost you more money than it saves.<\/p>\n<p>Most freelancers have a limited skill set. That\u2019s because it\u2019s rare for one person to have the money or the time to acquire the full range of skills involved in good <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/local-seo-company\/\">local SEO<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>And the frequent changes to Google\u2019s algorithms exacerbate this problem.<\/p>\n<p>According to Moz, Google changed its search algorithms over <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/blog\/how-often-does-google-update-its-algorithm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">3000<\/a> times in 2018 alone.<\/p>\n<p>And they\u2019re still going strong, as you can see from this chart from SEMRush, one of the top traffic analysis tools, showing SERP volatility changes for just a few days in March.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15177\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/serp-volatility.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"352\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/serp-volatility.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/serp-volatility-75x43.png 75w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Because of these changes, there is no guarantee that a site can stay on the first page of the results once it lands there.

Quality Content Creation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>No matter the industry, content creation is the <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/benefits-high-quality-content-consistency-brand#:~:text=Customers%20are%20more%20likely%20to,make%20an%20educated%20purchasing%20decision.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">surest path<\/a> to increased engagement and conversions. Content creation is <a href=\"https:\/\/review42.com\/content-marketing-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">3 times<\/a> more effective in generating leads than outbound marketing.<\/p>\n<p>Good content is substantive, authoritative, and relevant. It establishes you as an expert and aligns neatly with the needs of your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, as with everything else in digital marketing, the definition of quality is kind of a moving target.<\/p>\n<p>It changes to adapt to the changing needs of a digital audience, as reflected by evolving search algorithms.<\/p>\n<p>An expert will be able to deliver content that is consistently high quality and to tweak it as necessary to meet algorithm changes and evolving reader demands.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"2_Technical_SEO_Strategies\">2. Technical SEO Strategies<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Do users enjoy visiting your website? Does your keyword strategy guarantee that people can find you easily through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/how-popular-is-voice-search\/\">voice search<\/a>? Does your site load quickly via mobile? Do you have click optimized Title Tags?<\/p>\n<p>All of these technical elements are critical for your site to rank.<\/p>\n<p>In February 2019, Google announced that even a one-second delay in loading your page can reduce conversions by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/marketing-strategies\/app-and-mobile\/mobile-site-speed-importance\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">20%<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a graphic that shows the casualties of page loading time in more detail.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15174\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/load-time-delay.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"184\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/danealexandercopywriter.com.au\/5-ways-instantly-reduce-load-time-google\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>In today\u2019s digital world, voice search and mobile experience are key technical elements of any good website. So it\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/why-is-seo-important\/\">important to find an affordable SEO<\/a> agency who can deliver these.<\/p>\n<p>But, keep in mind that while voice search and mobile experience are crucial right now, this again could change, and a new set of technical strategies may be necessary for the future.<\/p>\n<p>Take a look at this graphic illustrating the changes in good SEO consulting from the early 2000s until today.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15175\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/technical-seo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"624\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/technical-seo.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/technical-seo-500x500.png 500w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/technical-seo-400x400.png 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Just in the last ten years, we\u2019ve seen an evolution as content became more important, and black hat strategies like keyword stuffing gradually lost their effectiveness.<\/p>\n<p>So of course, there is no telling what technical strategies may be important a few years from now.<\/p>\n<p>A quality but affordable SEO consultant will be nimble in adjusting to these evolving technology needs.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"3_Quality_Backlinking\">3. Quality Backlinking<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>High-quality backlinks to authoritative sites are a clear signal of your trustworthiness.<\/p>\n<p>Quality backlinks are such a clear signal of value that they are one of Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/search-traffic-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">top three<\/a> ranking factors.<\/p>\n<p>You absolutely can\u2019t afford to ignore them, and neither can your SEO consultant.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Importance_of_Customized_SEO_Packages\">The Importance of Customized SEO Packages<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/case-study\/varco-pruden\/\">Varco Pruden Buildings<\/a> (VP) experienced firsthand the importance of choosing the right SEO package.<\/p>\n<p>After performing a full analysis of their website, Higher Visibility created and implemented a digital marketing strategy just for them.<\/p>\n<p>Far from the one-size-fits-all approach employed by less reputable SEO consulting services, they tailored their approach to VP\u2019s needs.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, the package that worked for them included internal linking, content development, and quality link building.<\/p>\n<p>The result was dramatic.<\/p>\n<p>VP increased their organic traffic by 700% and rose to page 1 of the search rankings.<\/p>\n<p>As you can see from this example, the money spent on quality SEO consulting can directly impact the amount of money you make.<\/p>\n<p>Conversely, any amount you pay to a cheap, low-quality SEO consulting service can end up counting as a loss, because it won\u2019t bring in results, and may even harm your bottom line.<\/p>\n<p>Remember the time that you paid a cheap, freelance surgeon to perform your knee surgery?<\/p>\n<p>Neither do we. Not only would it be painful, but ultimately, very costly.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_Conclusion\">In Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>So is the price of professional SEO services still going up?<\/p>\n<p>The short answer is yes.<\/p>\n<p>But in the long run, professional SEO services are still more affordable than cheap SEO.<\/p>\n<p>Why?<\/p>\n<p>Because only an SEO expert can deliver high-quality content, technical expertise, and trustworthy backlinks. And these are the elements that have consistently proven to drive organic traffic and, ultimately, conversions.<\/p>\n<p>Just like a good surgeon, a qualified SEO expert will spend time talking to you about what you need and helping you set realistic goals.<\/p>\n<p>Because in the long term, there is nothing more affordable than a good investment.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"MOST_Websites_STRUGGLE_WITH_GENERATING_NEW_Leads_salesWE_FIX_THAT-3\">MOST Websites STRUGGLE WITH GENERATING NEW Leads & sales...WE FIX THAT!<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many businesses grow strategically through SEO.
