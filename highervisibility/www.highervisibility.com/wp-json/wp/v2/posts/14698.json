With an RFP, you\u2019ll be able to offer a clear-cut proposal that prospective agencies can visualize and understand better, which is helpful for both parties. It\u2019ll also allow you to discuss what you\u2019re looking for within your company internally, so you can skip the \u201cmultiple revisions\u201d stage that comes with weak RFPs.<\/p>\n<p>Relying on the RFP process will also make sure the firms have a written set of criteria so they can come back with solutions that fit the selection criteria you\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<p>A digital marketing RFP is perfect for those looking for an outside entity \u2014 specifically a digital marketing agency \u2014 to help you bring your company to the next level through social media, Google Analytics, or other technological solutions.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Why_Use_an_Online_Marketing_RFP_Template\">Why Use an Online Marketing RFP Template?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Searching for a digital agency that aligns with your aspirations and values can be a tricky process. In fact, the online marketing RFP writing process itself is challenging.<\/p>\n<p>It can be extremely time-consuming. Unless you have hours and hours of free time, it can be challenging to carve out time during the day to work on an online marketing RFP.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes, as an RFP writer, it can be hard to know precisely what you desire from a firm. A digital marketing RFP template will lay that out for you nicely so you can pinpoint exactly what you want from the agency.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, writing a digital marketing RFP is risky. Imagine spending hours and hours writing what seems to be the perfect proposal only for it to go nowhere.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019re no strangers to online marketing RFPs \u2014 we\u2019ve seen some truly impressive proposals and a handful of laughable RFPs. But our digital marketing RFP template makes it easier for both parties: Not only will it be easier to write and organize, but that\u2019ll make it easy for the company to review it as well.<\/p>\n<p>Digital marketing RFPs don\u2019t have to be an enigma. Our template should guide you through every part of the process. We\u2019ll also share some helpful tips and tricks that might make the process even easier for you.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Whats_Usually_Included_in_an_Online_Marketing_RFP\">What\u2019s Usually Included in an Online Marketing RFP<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The beautiful thing about digital marketing RFPs is that they can be very versatile, depending on the company or person writing them.<\/p>\n<p>Although your RFP can be whatever you envision, we\u2019re going to cover some common areas that online marketing RFPs usually include. That being said, not all of these topics will apply to you, and even if they do, you might choose to omit some aspects \u2014 that\u2019s all to be expected.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Your_company\">Your company<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>One of the best places to start is who you are. Unless your company already has a robust digital presence, chances are, the firms you contact won\u2019t be familiar with your company, and that\u2019s OK.<\/p>\n<p>Here, you\u2019ll want to share information about your company\u2019s background, where it is now, where you\u2019re looking to go, and any core values and missions that you\u2019d like to include. How many employees do you have? Is there more than one location?<\/p>\n<p>This might also be an appropriate place to briefly explain why you\u2019re interested in digital marketing. You can also end with a concise summary of what you\u2019re looking for in an agency partner. For example, you might want agencies that have years of experience in a particular area.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Your_current_digital_presence\">Your current digital presence<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019ll want to be as honest and accurate as possible in this section. Here, you\u2019ll be describing your current digital presence and what that looks like.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d suggest detailing the current online marketing strategies your company uses, including what\u2019s working, what isn\u2019t, and what you wish could work better.<\/p>\n<p>Within this sphere, you can also discuss any and all marketing challenges that come to mind when you think of your digital presence. For example, maybe you\u2019re struggling with low retention rates, or perhaps the in-house content you have isn\u2019t up to par for your audience.<\/p>\n<p>Even if it\u2019s painful to recall your shortcomings and what\u2019s not working for you, this will be the best way for potential firms to know how to develop a personalized marketing strategy for you and your business. Everyone faces marketing program challenges, and you shouldn&#8217;t be ashamed of them.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Who_your_competitors_are\">Who your competitors are<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Identifying at least three competitors (and their websites) will help potential firms see who you\u2019re up against. Agencies can then know what you\u2019re doing well compared to companies that might already be doing it better.<\/p>\n<p>You might also consider sharing any of the competitors\u2019 social media accounts and advertising campaigns that impress you, so the potential agencies can tailor their solution to hitting some of those marketing goals.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Your_target_audience\">Your target audience<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>When you think of your ideal customer, what do they look like? In other words, who\u2019s your target audience? When thinking of your target audience, you\u2019ll want to include both demographic and even psychographic information to provide firms with a visual to the audience you\u2019re attracting.<\/p>\n<p>It would be worthwhile to create a few personas to show these agencies and help them better visualize the customer.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Your_overall_goal\">Your overall goal<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This is an excellent place to introduce your specific goals concisely. I wouldn\u2019t advise writing a lengthy goal that\u2019s bogged down with many details, since we\u2019ll get into the meat of your digital marketing RFP later. Pick one to three outcomes that you\u2019d like the online marketing firm to do for you.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Your_business_goals\">Your business goals<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Your business goals will probably be similar to your overall goal, but we\u2019ll dive a little deeper into this section. What do you want your future online marketing strategy to do, exactly? What would be a successful marketing strategy in your eyes?<\/p>\n<p>Make sure they\u2019re both realistic and achievable. For example, maybe you just want to increase your revenue for the next fiscal year. That\u2019s an entirely reasonable business goal.<\/p>\n<p>In this section (or in a new section), you can include the scope of the work you need, even if it\u2019s an estimate. For example, what are your specific needs per digital channel? To make it easier, you can also include a list of deliverables that you have in mind.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Your_objectives\">Your objectives<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In order to achieve your business goals, you\u2019ve got to have objectives \u2014 written plans that will help you get to the next level. This will help visualize the project overview, too.<\/p>\n<p>Although you might already know what your objectives are, you should be very granular on the exact scope of work based on what marketing services you want or think you need:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Improved search engine optimization (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO<\/a>) for your website<\/li>\n<li>Effective <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/ppc-management\/\">PPC<\/a> campaign<\/li>\n<li>A <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/social-media-marketing\/\">social media<\/a> strategy or campaign<\/li>\n<li>An email marketing strategy<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Your_time_frame\">Your time frame<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Some companies don\u2019t have a specific timeline, but if you do, include it here. How soon do you want to see results? This section will also help you avoid firms that don\u2019t have the bandwidth to finish this project based on your provided time frame.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Your_budget\">Your budget<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This section is essential. How much are you willing to pay these agencies to assist with a successful digital marketing strategy? This section, in particular, will help you steer clear of agencies that aren\u2019t willing to meet you in the middle.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you don\u2019t have a budget, you should still include a range so the firm will have some idea of what the costs will be.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Selection_timeline_and_requirements\">Selection timeline and requirements<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>To better help you stick to a rigid timeline, outline some critical dates that will affect your selection process. For example, you could include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>When the proposals are due<\/li>\n<li>A timeline of the question and answer period<\/li>\n<li>When you\u2019ll select an agency<\/li>\n<li>What date the project will start<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>On the first day, you\u2019ll send out the digital marketing RFP, and a few days later, you might choose to cut off anyone who doesn\u2019t RSVP. You\u2019ll probably schedule a few calls with viable firms for about a week and answer any questions they might have. A week after that, it might be time for the firms to submit their proposals. Although this is an example, the actual timeline is entirely up to you.<\/p>\n<p>In this section, you can also detail how you\u2019ll choose an agency partner. Will you use a scoring system? What selection criteria will you include?<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Standard_Master_Services_Agreement\">Standard Master Services Agreement<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Your company\u2019s legal team might suggest you use a standard Master Services Agreement, also called an MSA. If this is the case, a potential firm or agency might also include their own terms and conditions.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"What_you_expect_in_return\">What you expect in return<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>What information would you like from potential firms? If you clearly state what sort of information you expect, the likely agencies can better cater to providing it. You might prefer to know the history of the agency, examples of case studies, what qualifications and experience it has, account management process, and pricing, among other pieces of intel.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Contact_and_questions\">Contact and questions<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You should provide a point of contact for agencies to reach out to, whether it&#8217;s your public relations director or another trusted key stakeholder. You should include their:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full legal name<\/li>\n<li>Job title<\/li>\n<li>Mailing address<\/li>\n<li>Email and phone number<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That way, you can direct any specific questions that might come up during the proposal period to one single contact to make it easier.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Why_Its_Important_to_Nail_Your_RFP\">Why It\u2019s Important to Nail Your RFP<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>So, you\u2019ve got an idea of how to write an online marketing RFP \u2014 but why is it so important to get it right?<\/p>\n<p>A proposal is essentially your one change to vet firms before you listen to their pitch. It\u2019ll help you steer clear of firms that won\u2019t be a good fit and, in turn, will prevent you from wasting time. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so critical to be as detailed as possible when you\u2019re creating a digital marketing RFP.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Final_Thoughts\">Final Thoughts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>An online marketing RFP is what you make it. There\u2019s lots of room to be creative and have fun with it during the RFP process. Staying positive is key, as this proposal is going to be what effectively drives your digital marketing strategy and what determines which agency you might partner with within the next few weeks.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where our digital marketing RFP template comes in. It\u2019ll provide you with a meaningful way to organize your proposal so as to make it clear to both parties. With this template, the digital marketing possibilities are virtually endless.
