Those listings are called search results. Within those search results you will find paid listings, but the bulk of the results are made up of what are called organic listings. The organic results are the free listings that the search engines have found, through their analysis, to be the most relevant to the user\u2019s query.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Being listed at the top in the organic listings is at the root of why SEO is so important. Organic results currently receive a significantly greater share of traffic in comparison to paid ads. So, if your business isn\u2019t being found in the organic listings, you are missing out on a large percentage of the consumer market.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Getting to the top of the results is where search engine optimization comes in. There are numerous strategies and techniques that go into creating a relevant and optimized website to truly compete for the keywords that can generate revenue for your business. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See Also: \u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/why-is-seo-important\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why is SEO Important?<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_Get_Started_with_SEO\"><b>How to Get Started with SEO<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Basic SEO isn\u2019t hard to get started with, it just takes time and plenty of patience. Web pages don\u2019t typically rank overnight for competitive keywords. If you are willing to create a solid foundation of optimization for your website, and put in the time to build upon it, you will achieve success and grow your organic traffic. Businesses that cut corners may achieve short-term results, but they almost always fail in the long term and it is very difficult for them to recover.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how do you go about optimizing your website? You must first understand how the search engines work as well as the various techniques that make up SEO. To make it easier to navigate, we have linked each section below so that you can jump to the section that interests you.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"#rank\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Does Google Rank Websites?<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"#on\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On-Page SEO (HTML, Content, Etc.)<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"#off\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Page SEO (Link Building, Social, Etc.)<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"#success\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO Success Metrics<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"#win\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creating a Winning SEO Strategy<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"#results\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Should I Expect to See Results?<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"#hat\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">White Hat vs. Black Hat SEO<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"#future\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Future of Search Engine Optimization<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"#tools\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO Tools &amp; Resources<\/span><\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"rank\"><span id=\"How_Does_Google_Rank_Websites\"><b>How Does Google Rank Websites?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The search engines use automated robots, also known as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/seo-spiders\/\">web crawlers<\/a> or spiders, to scan and catalog web pages, PDFs, image files, etc. for possible inclusion in their massive indexes. From there, each web page and file is evaluated by programs called algorithms that determine if a file offers enough unique value to be included into the index.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If a file is deemed valuable enough to be added into the index, the file or web page will only be displayed in search results that the algorithms have determined are relevant and meets the intent of the user\u2019s query. This is the true secret to the success of the search engines. The better they answer a user\u2019s queries, the more likely it is that the user will use them in the future. It is generally accepted, as evidenced by the sheer number of their users, that Google delivers more relevant results because of their highly sophisticated algorithms that they are constantly improving. In an effort to maintain their competitive advantage, it is believed that Google makes 500-600 updates to their algorithm each year.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">User intent is playing a greater role in how search engines rank web pages. For example, if a user is searching for \u201cSEO companies,\u201d is the user looking for articles on how to start an SEO company, or are they looking for a listing of SEO companies that provide the service? In this case, the latter is more likely. Even though there is a small chance that the user may be looking to start an SEO business, Google (with their expansive data on user habits) understands that the vast majority will be expecting to see a listing of companies. All of this is built into Google\u2019s algorithm.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Search_Engine_Ranking_Factors\"><b>Search Engine Ranking Factors<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As stated previously, these algorithms are highly sophisticated, so there are numerous factors that these programs are considering to determine relevance. In addition, Google and the other search engines work very hard to prevent businesses from \u201cgaming\u201d the system and manipulating the results. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how many ranking factors are there? Well, back on May 10, 2006, Google\u2019s Matt Cutts declared that there are over 200 search ranking signals that Google considers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Then, in 2010, Matt Cutts stated that those 200+ search ranking factors each had up to 50 variations. That would bring the actual number to over 1,000 unique signals. Even though there are so many signals, they don\u2019t each carry an equal amount of weight. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For websites wanting to rank for nationally competitive keywords, the signals that matter most are related to on-page, off-page, and penalty-related factors. On-Page optimization is related to content, and for a website to have a chance to rank for competitive search phrases, the content needs to be very relevant and answer the search user\u2019s query. Off-page factors are related to the link popularity of the website and how authoritative external sources find your content. As for the penalty-related factors, if you are caught violating Google\u2019s Webmaster Guidelines, you are not going to be competitive at all.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For websites that are looking to rank in their local market, the factors are very similar except for the addition of Google My Business, <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/local-listings\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">local listings<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, and reviews. Google My Business and citations help verify the actual location of the business and its service area. Reviews assist in determining the popularity of that local business. <\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"on\"><span id=\"On-Page_SEO\"><b>On-Page SEO<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On-page SEO is the optimization of the HTML code and content of the website as opposed to off-page SEO, which pertains to links and other external signals pointing to the website. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The overall goal behind on-page SEO is to make sure that the search engines can find your content, and that the content on the web pages is optimized to rank for the thematically relevant keywords that you would like to target. You have to go about things the right way, however. Each page should have its own unique theme. You should not be forcing optimization onto a web page. If the keywords don\u2019t match the theme of your product or service, you may just need to create a different page just for that particular set of keywords.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you optimize the title, description, and headings while creating content appropriately, the end user will have a significantly better experience on your website as they will have found the content that they were expecting to find. If you misrepresent the content in the title tag and description, it will lead to higher bounce rates on your website as visitors will leave quickly when they aren\u2019t finding what they expect. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That is the high level overview of on-page SEO. There are several key topics regarding on-page optimization that we are going to cover including HTML coding, keyword research, and content optimization. These are foundational items that need to be addressed to have a chance at higher rankings in the search engines.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Website_Audit\"><b>Website Audit<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your website is having difficulty ranking, you may want to start with an <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/seo-audit\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO audit<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. You need a 360-degree analysis to identify your website\u2019s shortcomings so that you can correct them and put your site back on a more solid foundation. An audit can help identify glitches or deficiencies, both on and off page, that may be holding your website back from ranking for your targeted keywords.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are SEO crawling tools that can help you identify basic technical issues fairly easily, making that part of the auditing process much more efficient. An audit typically would not stop at a technical analysis. Content and the link profile of a website also play a significant role in the ranking ability of a website. If you don\u2019t have quality content or authoritative links, it will be difficult to rank for highly competitive search phrases.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>See Also: \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/technical-seo-audit-process-anyone-can-follow\/\">Technical SEO Audit Process + Checklist<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"HTTPS_Security\"><b>HTTPS Security<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google, in an effort to create a safer and more secure web experience for their search users, has been pressing webmasters to secure their websites. Safe experiences are important for Google\u2019s search engine. If search users have confidence in the safety of the results being displayed, they will be more likely to continue using Google\u2019s search engine in the future. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Google might have a good reason to encourage webmasters to secure their sites, webmasters have just as much incentive. When people are purchasing online, potential customers are going to feel much more confident completing a transaction with a site that is secure versus one that isn\u2019t. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To strongly encourage webmasters to secure their websites, Google has integrated SSL as a search ranking factor. Websites that do have SSL certificates will be favored slightly above those that do not. It isn\u2019t a big factor, but enough that if all other factors are equal, the site that is secured will win out.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mobile-Friendly_Design\"><b>Mobile-Friendly Design<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 60% of all search queries are conducted on a mobile device now. Google is working to create the best possible search experience; therefore, they need to give preference to websites that are improving their mobile usability. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Providing a better mobile experience can be done in several ways. The most common method is that webmasters are creating responsive designs that will adjust based on the size of the browser that you are viewing from. Other sites have a mobile-specific version of their web page that is displayed when the server detects that the user is utilizing a mobile browser. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The speed at which mobile pages load is also important. Google backs a project called Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) and, in 2016, they integrated AMP listings into their mobile search results. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Taking into consideration that the majority of searches are now mobile based, Google is creating a mobile-first index. This will become Google\u2019s primary index of web pages, and it has been rolling out slowly since the end of 2017. Should you be concerned if your site isn\u2019t mobile friendly? Maybe not in the short term, but in the coming months, yes. Websites that provide a good mobile experience will have a greater ability to rank higher in the search results. This isn\u2019t just Google, however. Bing is moving in this direction as well.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>See Also: \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/how-googles-mobile-first-index-works\/\">How Google&#8217;s Mobile-First Index Works<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Website_Page_Speed\"><b>Website Page Speed<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Page speed is the length of time it takes for a web page to load. With Google\u2019s mobile-first index, page speed is going to play a greater role as a ranking factor. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once again, it is about the user\u2019s experience. Visitors to a website just don\u2019t want to wait for pages to load. The longer it takes for your web page to load, the greater the chance that the visitor will leave (bounce) and visit your competitor\u2019s site. Google did a study and found that the difference between a 1s web page load time and a 5s time increased the odds that the visitor will bounce by 90%. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to pay attention to the rate at which visitors bounce off your website, as this is also a ranking factor. Not only that, those are lost revenue opportunities. Google cares about these metrics because they need to keep their search users happy with the results being displayed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several things that you can do to improve page speed. Some of these items include the following:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Enabling file compression<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Minifying CSS, Javascript, and HTML<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Reducing page redirects<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Removing render-blocking JavaScript<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leveraging browser caching<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Improving server response time<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using CDNs (Content Distribution Networks)<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Optimizing image file sizes<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Website_Crawlability\"><b>Website Crawlability<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Search engine robots visit your website and make copies of each page for consideration into their index. If they deem the content valuable, they will include it in their index so that their search users can find it. That is why it is important to make sure that the search engines can easily find the pages within your website. If they can\u2019t find your content, it can\u2019t be included in their index for others to find.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are technical problems that can prevent search robots from crawling your website, but most websites don\u2019t experience these issues. One issue is that some websites use JavaScript and Flash, which can sometimes hide links from the search engines. When a robot is crawling a website, they crawl by visiting the links found within a web page. If they don\u2019t see the link, they won\u2019t crawl it, meaning they won\u2019t know to consider the page for indexing. Another common crawling issue is the accidental inclusion of a \u201cnoindex\u201d tag on a web page or the blocking of entire folders of a website from being crawled through the robots.txt file. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One way to help ensure your content is seen is by creating a sitemap.xml file. This file lists out the various URLs for a website, making it easier for the search engine robots to find the content of your website. Sitemap files are especially helpful for websites with thousands of pages, as links to some content may be buried deep within your website and harder for the search engines to find right away. As a general rule, you should update this file whenever new pages are added. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Avoiding_Page_Content_Duplication\"><b>Avoiding Page &amp; Content Duplication <\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Duplicate content can harm the ranking ability of some of the most important pages of your website. When Google is looking at the pages of your website and finds nearly identical content between two or more pages, they may have difficulty prioritizing which one is more important. As a result, it is very possible they will all suffer in the rankings. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some unintentional, yet common causes of content duplication:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WWW and Non-WWW versions resolving: If the website resolves for both versions instead of one redirecting to the other, Google may index both versions. Google has done a much better job about handling this, but it does remain a possibility. You can solve this issue by ensuring that you have proper 301 redirects in place.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pagination: This is very common <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/ecommerce-seo-services\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">ecommerce SEO<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> issue, but does happen with others. Let\u2019s say that you have a website that sells shoes with a category called \u201cblue shoes.\u201d You may sell hundreds of different \u201cblue shoes\u201d and you don\u2019t want to show any more than 20 different styles at a time. In this instance, you would probably have multiple pages that you can click-through. As you click, you notice you are going to a web page with a URL of \u201cblue-shoes\/page2\/\u201d. That activity is called pagination. If not handled properly, Google may index every single page, each consisting of nearly identical content, when in reality you want the main category to be the ranking page within the search results. You can solve this problem by using rel=canonical tags.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">URL Parameters: Staying with our \u201cblue shoes\u201d example, you may want to see what is available in a size 12. You click to sort to find what is available in a size 12, you stay on the page, but you notice the URL now says \u201cblue-shoes?size=12\u201d. The \u201csize=12\u201d is a URL parameter. Sometimes these URL parameters are indexed. This is another very common occurrence for ecommerce websites. You can solve this by using rel=canonical tags or by handling URL parameters through Google Search Console.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Structured_Data\"><b>Structured Data<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/understanding-google-rich-snippets\/\">Structured data<\/a> is organized information that can help the search engines understand your website better. Through the collaboration of Google, Bing, Yandex, and Yahoo; Schema.org was created to standardize the HTML markup of this information. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there is no conclusive proof that structured data can improve your search rankings, it can help enhance your listings, which can improve your click-through rate. Click-through rate is something that is widely accepted as a ranking factor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are some enhanced listing features as a result of structured data:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Star ratings and review data<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Knowledge graphs<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breadcrumbs within your search result<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Inclusion in a rich snippet box for a result<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Implementing structured data is also helping you prepare for how search is evolving. Search engines are trying to provide instant answers to questions, which will play an even greater role with voice search.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>See Also: \u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/understanding-google-rich-snippets\/\">Understanding Google Rich Snippets<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Role_of_Domain_Names\"><b>Role of Domain Names <\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There has long been a discussion regarding the value of having a keyword in the domain name. There was a time when there was a very strong correlation with ranking ability, but as the algorithms have evolved, that signal has diminished in importance. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That does not mean there isn\u2019t value there, however. It simply means that you shouldn\u2019t place a big focus on the domain name containing the keyword when there are so many signals that are more important.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"SEO-Friendly_URL_Structures\"><b>SEO-Friendly URL Structures<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">URLs are one of the first things that a search user will notice. The structure of the URL not only has the ability to impact the click-through rates of your search listings, but can also impact your website\u2019s search ranking ability.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keywords in the URL:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It is a best practice to include keywords in the URL as long as it accurately represents the content of the page. This will give additional confidence to the search user that the page contains the content that they are looking for while also reinforcing the important keywords to the search engines. Going with our blue shoes example, a URL would look like this: \u201c\/blue-suede-shoes\/\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See Also: \u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/resource\/research\/how-valuable-is-it-to-have-a-keyword-in-your-domain-url\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Valuable is it to Have a Keyword in Your Domain URL?<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t Keyword Stuff URLs:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> There is something to be said for having a little too much of something. Sometimes when you have too much, it can work against you, and the same goes for keywords in a URL. When you over-optimize, search users will see a spammy-looking URL, and that could hurt your click-through rates, but the search engines could also think that you are trying to game the system. A keyword-stuffed URL would look like this: \u201c\/shoes\/blue-shoes\/blue-suede\/best-blue-suede-shoes\/\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pay Attention to URL Length:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Keep your URL length at a minimum. Google will truncate URLs that are too long, and that can impact your click-through rate.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Avoid Dynamic URL Strings:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Whenever possible, try to have a static URL with keywords versus a dynamic URL that contains symbols and numbers. They aren\u2019t descriptive and will not help your listing\u2019s click-through rate. A dynamic URL will look something like this: \u201c\/cat\/?p=3487\u201d<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Title_Tags\"><b>Title Tags<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A title tag is the HTML code that forms the clickable headline that can be found in the search engine result pages (SERPs). The title tag is extremely important to the click-through rate of your search listing. It is the first thing that a search user will read about your page and you only have a brief few seconds to capture their attention and convince them that they will find what they are seeking if they click on your listing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are some quick tips for writing title tags:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Title tags should contain keywords relevant to the contents of the web page.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You should place important keywords near the beginning of the title.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try to keep titles between 50-60 characters in length. Google actually is looking for about 600 pixels, which 60 characters will fit within roughly 90% of the time. Beyond the 600 pixels, Google will display a truncated title, and your title might not have the impact that you intended.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whenever possible, use adjectives to enhance the title. Example: The <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Complete<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Guide to SEO.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t stuff your title with keywords. It will look spammy, and users will be less likely to click on your listing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t have web pages with duplicate titles. Each page needs to accurately describe its own unique content.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you have room, try to incorporate your brand name. This can be a great way to generate some brand recognition. If you already have a strong brand, this may even improve the click-through rate of your search listing.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Meta_Description_Tags\"><b>Meta Description Tags<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A meta description tag is the HTML code that describes the content of a web page to a search user. The description can be found in the search engine result pages (SERPs), underneath the title and URL of a search listing. The description, while not a ranking signal itself, plays an important role with SEO. If you provide a relevant, well-written, enticing description; the click-through rate of the search listing will most likely be higher. This can lead to a greater share of traffic and a potential improvement in search rankings, as click-through rate is a search ranking factor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are some quick tips for writing description tags:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use keywords, but don\u2019t be spammy with them. Keywords within a search query will be bolded in the description.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The rule of thumb used to be to have the length of a description to be no longer than 155 characters. Google is now displaying, in many instances, up to 320 characters. This is great from a search listing real estate perspective, and you should try to utilize as many of those 320 characters as possible. When doing so, make sure you get a clear message across in the first 155 characters just in case it gets truncated for a query.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accurately describe the content of the web page. If people are misled, your bounce rate will be higher and will potentially harm the position of your listing.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Meta_Keywords_Tags\"><b>Meta Keywords Tags<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The meta keywords tag is HTML code that was designed to allow you to provide guidance to the search engines as to the specific keywords the web page is relevant for. In 2009, both Google and Yahoo announced that they hadn\u2019t used the tag for quite some time, and in 2014, Bing acknowledged the same. As a best practice, most SEOs don\u2019t use the tag at all anymore.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Header_Tags\"><b>Header Tags<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A header tag is HTML code that notes the level of importance of each heading on a web page. You can use 6 heading elements: H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6; with H1 being the most significant and H6 the least. Typically the title of an article or the name of a category, product, or service is given the H1 Tag, as they are generally the most prominent and important heading. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Headings used to play an important role in the optimization of a web page, and the search engines would take them into consideration. While they might not carry the same weight they once did, it is still widely believed they offer some ranking value and it is best to include them. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As an SEO best practice, it is best that you utilize only one H1 tag, as this will signify the primary theme of the web page. All other headings should use H2-H6 depending on their level of importance. From an optimization standpoint, it is safe to use multiple H2-H6 tags.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Competitor_Research\"><b>Competitor Research<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Conducting a competitor analysis is a strategic function of properly optimizing a website. This can help you identify areas that your business\u2019s website might not be covering. The analysis will help drive the keyword research and content development so that improvements can be made.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are some quick tips for conducting competitor research for SEO:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Architectural Flow:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Look at the flow of the content on your competitor\u2019s websites. Analyze how they have it structured architecturally to get deeper into the site. There may be some important takeaways from a website that ranks well, and that may make you decide to plan out your website differently.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword Gap Analysis:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Use a tool like SEMRush or Ahrefs to view the keywords that your competitors are ranking for. Compare that list to what you are ranking for and determine if there are any gaps that you need to cover.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Backlink Analysis:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Similar to a keyword gap analysis, you can also do that for backlinks. Backlinks are extremely important to the algorithms of the search engines, so you might find some easy wins by seeing where your competition has links. There are great tools such as Ahrefs and Majestic that can help you find these backlinks.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Keyword_Research\"><b>Keyword Research<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword research is essential to any SEO campaign, and this is one area where you don\u2019t want to cut corners. You need to understand how people search for your specific products, services, or information. Without knowing this, it will be difficult to structure your content to give your website a chance to rank for valuable search queries. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest mistakes that a webmaster can make is focusing solely on ranking for one or two keywords. Often, there are some highly competitive, high-volume keywords that you feel you must rank for in order to be successful. Those keywords tend to be one to two words in length, and there is a pretty good chance your competitors are working hard on those very same keywords. Those make for good longer-term goals, and you should still optimize for those, but the real value is in long-tail keywords.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long-tail keywords make up the vast majority of all search volume. These keywords are more specific, longer phrases that someone will type in, such as \u201cblue 4-inch high heel shoes.\u201d This is much more descriptive than \u201cblue shoes,\u201d even though that word might have a higher search volume. With these keywords being so much more descriptive, these types of customers also tend to be more in-market to transact now.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See Also: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/top-5-free-keyword-research-tools\/\">10 Free Keyword Research Tools<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"SEO_Copywriting_Content_Optimization\"><b>SEO Copywriting &amp; Content Optimization<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You have probably heard that \u201ccontent is king\u201d when it comes to SEO. The thing about content is that it drives a lot of factors related to optimization. You need quality content to have a chance at ranking for the keywords that you are targeting, but for you to have success, you also need to have content on your website that webmasters find interesting enough to want to link back to. Not every page can do both. Pages that are sales focused, such as product and service pages, aren\u2019t usually the kind of content that webmasters want to link to. Link generation from content will most likely come from your blog or other informational resources on your website.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are some quick tips for content optimization:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Understand your audience and focus writing your content for them. Don\u2019t force something that won\u2019t resonate. You will risk losing sales and increasing your visitor bounce rate.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Utilize the keyword research that you have performed. You should naturally work important keyword phrases (that you identified through your research) into your content. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be certain the keywords that you are optimizing for are relevant to the overall theme of the page.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Don\u2019t overdo it with keyword frequency. Important keywords should be in headings with a few mentions throughout the copy. Search engines use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/resource\/guide\/a-look-at-lsi\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">latent semantic indexing<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to process synonyms and the relationship between words, so just focus on writing naturally. If you use the same keywords over and over, it won\u2019t sound natural, and you risk over-optimizing with the search engines. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be thorough when writing. <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/30-content-marketing-statistics-trends-data-strategy\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Content marketing statistics<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> show that long-form content is nine times more effective than short form. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Write headlines that will capture the visitor\u2019s attention.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Try to incorporate images, charts, and videos to make the content more engaging.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tell a story and, whenever possible, include a call to action.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>See Also: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/seo-writing\/\">SEO Writing: Creating SEO Friendly Content in 6 Easy Steps<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Breadcrumbs\"><b>Breadcrumbs<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Breadcrumbs can play an important role in helping Google better determine the structure of your website. They often show how content is categorized within a website and also provides built in internal linking to category pages within your website. When placing breadcrumbs, make sure to use structured data as Google may also choose to include these breadcrumb links within your SERP listing<\/span>.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See Also: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/breadcrumbs-seo\/\">Bread Crumbs &amp; SEO: What are They and How They&#8217;re Important for SEO<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Internal_Linking\"><b>Internal Linking<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To understand the importance of internal link building, you need to understand the concept of \u201clink juice.\u201d Link juice is the authority or equity passed from one web page or website to another. So with each link, internal or external, there is a certain amount of value that is passed.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you write content for your website, you need to take into consideration whether there are any other relevant web pages on your site that would be appropriate to link to from that content. This promotes the flow of \u201clink juice,\u201d but it also provides users the benefit of links to other relevant information on your website.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"off\"><span id=\"Off-Page_SEO\"><b>Off-Page SEO<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Off-Page SEO (also known as Off-Site SEO) refers to optimization strategies that are enacted outside of your website that may influence the rankings within the search engine results pages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A large portion of Google\u2019s algorithm is focused on how the outside world (the web) views the trustworthiness of your website. You may have the best-looking website with the most robust content, but if you don\u2019t put in the work to get noticed, odds are good that your website won\u2019t rank very well. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since Google\u2019s algorithm is non-human, it relies heavily on outside signals such as links from other websites, article\/press mentions, social media mentions, and reviews to help determine the value of the information on your website.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Importance_of_Link_Building\"><b>Importance of Link Building<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While it would be difficult to rank without quality content, you won\u2019t have any chance on competitive keyword phrases without links. It is still universally accepted that the number and quality of inbound links to a website and\/or web page is the number one influencer of search rankings. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With link building as the top search signal, you must have a solid strategy to attract and acquire links for your website. That being said, you should not even start this process without having a solid foundation built with content and design. Acquiring links is much easier when you have attractive, valuable resources that other websites will want to link to.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Link_Quality\"><b>Link Quality<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to know that not all links are created equal. Google\u2019s algorithm looks closely at the trustworthiness of the linking website. For example, a link for the New York Times, which has millions of links and tens of thousands of reputable and unique websites linking to it, will carry much more weight than a link from your friend\u2019s free WordPress site he built a couple of weeks ago. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are tools that estimate the authority of a website. Two popular tools are Moz\u2019s Open Site Explorer, which calculates a Domain Authority score, and Ahref\u2019s Domain Rank. These tools are great for determining what links are worth acquiring. The higher the score\/rank, the more worthwhile it would be to spend time to acquire that link.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The number of links isn\u2019t the only thing that the search engines look at from a quality perspective. They will also take into consideration how relevant the linking website\/content is to your own site. If you are selling shoes, for example, a link from a fashion blog will carry more weight than a link from Joe\u2019s Pizza Shack. It may seem crazy to even try to get a link from a pizza place for a shoe website, but in the early days, search engines focused more on the quantity of links. As webmasters caught on, some would try to acquire every link they could find to influence search results. To ensure the quality of results, the search engines had to focus on quality to account for this potential spam.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Quantity_of_Links_for_a_WebsiteWeb_Page\"><b>The Quantity of Links for a Website\/Web Page<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though the greater focus is on the quality and relevance of links, quantity still has a place. You want to continue to grow the number of authoritative links pointing to your website and its important web pages so that you have the ability to challenge your competition on highly competitive keywords. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another aspect to the quantity discussion is that it is better to have 100 total links from 100 different websites as opposed to having 100 links coming from 10 websites. There is a strong correlation that the more links your website has from unique domains, the better chance you have for ranking improvement.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Of course, once you obtain top rankings, you can\u2019t take a break. If you aren\u2019t growing your link profile, you can trust that your competitors are, and they will eventually surpass you. For this reason, SEO has become a necessary ongoing marketing function for most organizations.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Link_Anchor_Text\"><b>Link Anchor Text<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anchor text is the actual highlighted hyperlink text on a web page that directs a user to a different web page upon clicking. How websites link to you does make a difference in the search engine algorithms, and anchor text is part of that equation. The search engines look to anchor text as a signal for a web page\u2019s relevance for specific search phrases. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Example: Getting a link with the anchor text of \u201cBlue Shoes\u201d on a fashion blog, would indicate to the search engines that your web page must be relevant to \u201cblue shoes.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the past, the more links you had pointing to your web pages that contain specific keywords, the more likely you would rank for that keyword. There is still some truth to that, but if you have a high percentage of your links containing keywords, the search engines will suspect you are trying to manipulate the results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A natural link profile generally contains a varied mix of anchor text, usually dominated by linking text that includes a website\u2019s brand name. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Link_Placement\"><b>Link Placement<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another factor that the search engines consider is the location of where the link is placed. This plays a role with how much weight or \u201clink juice\u201d will be passed to your own web page from the linking website. Footer and sidebar links are not given as much weight as they once were because of the abuse related to websites selling links in the past. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Links within the body or content of the web page generally designate greater importance to the topic being discussed and have more weight given to them. It is also widely accepted that the higher the link is within the content, the greater the weight and authority that is passed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Do-Follow_vs_No-Follow_Links\"><b>Do-Follow vs. No-Follow Links<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A do-follow link tells the search engines that the website is essentially vouching for the web page that they are linking to and that search engines should follow that link and pass the appropriate link juice accordingly. A no-follow link has HTML code containing \u00a0rel=\u201dnofollow\u201d to tell the search engines not to follow the link to the destination and pass any authority or credit. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">User-generated content such as comments, wikis, social bookmarks, forum posts, and even some articles have been abused by SEOs to obtain easy links for websites. No-follow links have become a very necessary part of search algorithms because of this user-generated content. Websites started placing the rel=\u201dnofollow\u201d tags to signify that they weren\u2019t vouching for the links. This has led to a significant reduction in spam that was being generated on those websites, as the value of obtaining a link was no longer there.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do-follow links are significantly more valuable because of the link juice and authority that is passed, but no-follow links are very natural to have in a link profile and can still offer value from the referral traffic that they may provide.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Earned_Links_vs_Buying\"><b>Earned Links vs. Buying<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Purchasing links for the purpose of building the authority of your website is against Google\u2019s guidelines and would put your website at risk of receiving a penalty. All purchased links for advertising purposes should be given a no-follow designation to keep your website out of harm\u2019s way. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Earned links are what the search engines actually want to give credit to. For a link to be \u201cearned,\u201d there has to be a clear and compelling reason for one website to want to link to another. Being cited in articles or as a resource on a list are all good examples, assuming that there is a clear and relevant connection between your content and the linking website. Going back to the shoe website example, a link from a fashion blog, within the article content and to your web page, that details the top shoes trends is one that has a clear connection. If your shoe trends page had a link from a pizza shop within their footer, that is something that would not give any appearance of being natural. There would be no clear reason that they would link to that page, as the page is not relevant to their business, audience, or content.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most reputable SEO companies offer <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/link-building\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">link building services<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> that create linkable assets or content to conduct outreach on your website\u2019s behalf in order to obtain these earned links. You can also do this yourself by building well-thought-out resources or content and contacting websites that you believe would find your resources link-worthy.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Social_Media_and_SEO\"><b>Social Media and SEO<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Even though many SEOs thought that social media was a ranking factor in Google\u2019s algorithm, in 2014 Google\u2019s Matt Cutts declared that it is not. In 2016, Gary <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Illyes, a Google Webmaster Trends Analyst, also confirmed that social media is not a ranking factor.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While social media might not be a direct contributor as a ranking factor, the following are a few ways social media can help improve SEO:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Link Acquisition:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you produce great content and people are sharing it through social channels, webmasters and bloggers might see that content and decide to link back to it on their actual websites. The more your content is shared, the greater your chances of naturally generating links will be.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Branded Searches:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> As your content, products, or services are discussed more frequently via social media, people will begin to seek you out on the search engines by typing in your brand name. If you offer a product or service, those search queries may contain your brand name plus the name of a product or service, like \u201c[Brand Name] blue shoes,\u201d for example. As Google or another search engine sees that you are relevant for a type of product or service based on actual customer queries, you may find yourself in a better position for the unbranded version of the query.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Positive Business Signals:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Many businesses have a social media presence. Having an active profile can show that you are actually making an effort to engage your customers. The search engines look at numerous pieces of data to determine the legitimacy of a business or website, and socials signals could potentially be seen as a validator.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"success\"><span id=\"SEO_Success_Metrics\"><b>SEO Success Metrics<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Every business is different, and the same can be said for their specific goals. SEO success can be measured in a variety of different ways. A plumber may want more phone calls, a retailer may want to sell more product, a magazine publisher may want to simply increase page views, and another business may just want to rank higher than their competitor. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are some common metrics for gauging the success of an SEO optimization campaign:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Leads\/Sales:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Most businesses are looking to receive a return on their investment regardless of the type of marketing medium. SEO marketing is no different in that regard. Ultimately, the best gauge of success is if the efforts lead to an increase in sales and leads. If sales are the goal, the focus of the campaign should revolve around search phrases that would attract in-market consumers versus keywords that are more inquisitive in nature. Keywords that are question-based may deliver traffic, but they typically have very low conversion rates. That should be part of a larger brand strategy after your bases are covered with your money keywords.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organic Search Traffic:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If your organic traffic is increasing, that is a good sign that your SEO campaign is working. It shows that you are moving up in the search rankings for your chosen keywords and that users are clicking on your search listings. If you know that you are ranking well for keywords that have decent search volume, but you aren\u2019t receiving much in terms of traffic, you may want to work on improving your Title Tag to generate a higher click-through rate. Within Google Search Console, you have the ability to view keywords and their corresponding click-through rate with your search listing.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword Rankings:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Many businesses look at keywords as an indicator of how a search campaign is performing. This can also be a misleading indicator if it isn\u2019t viewed in the right context. If you are solely focused on the performance of a few \u201chigh volume\u201d keywords, you could be feeling discouraged even though, through the eyes of a more seasoned <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/10-skills-every-seo-expert-should-have\/\">SEO expert<\/a>, you may be making great progress. Highly competitive keywords will take time, and sometimes a significant amount of time to achieve first page rankings. What you should be looking at is whether positive progress is being made on those terms, to the point you begin to see a path of obtaining your desired results over time.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword Diversity:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It is easy to look at the high volume, competitive keywords and feel that you need to rank for those to be successful. Those are great longer-term goals, but the fact remains: 70% of all search traffic is going to long-tail keywords. Tools like SEMRush and Ahrefs monitor millions of keywords and can show you how many keywords your site or web page is ranking for. If you see this number continue to increase, that is another good indicator that your campaign is going in the right direction.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See Also: \u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/best-tools-to-monitor-keyword-search-rankings\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best Tools to Monitor Keyword Search Rankings<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"win\"><span id=\"Creating_a_Winning_SEO_Strategy\"><b>Creating a Winning SEO Strategy<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Most businesses today know the basic concepts around SEO. You can do a lot of individual SEO functions well, but success comes with how you put the pieces together to form a cohesive strategy. \u00a0That strategy will create the foundation for organic traffic growth that will propel a business for years to come.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You need to be prepared to spend a significant amount of time mapping out the strategy because it is much better and more effective to do it right the first time. The following are some of the key components found in nearly every successful SEO strategy:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Identify Your Goals:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For a successful campaign, you first need to have a clear idea of what you are trying to accomplish. That will drive the strategy moving forward, as everything that you do will be to achieve that goal. For example, if your goal is to generate leads or sales, the structure of your website and the content written should be focused on sending customers into your sales funnel.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Focus on Topics:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Topics should dictate the design and flow of the website and its content. Knowing your products and services, make a list of high-level topics that will form the content pillars of your website. Typically, these topics are going to be the shorter-tail, higher-volume, and more competitive keywords.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do the Research:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> After you settle on the topics that properly describe your products and services, you need to perform research to find the longer-tail keywords that customers would search for to find information about those topics. This type of keyword often answers a wide range of questions.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create the Content:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When creating the pillar content, be as thorough as possible. The trends show that search engines have been placing a higher value on long-form content. From there, you create the supportive content based off long-tail research performed on the topics. The pillar content should link to the supportive content, and the supportive content should link back to the pillar. This will help formulate a semantic relationship that search engines love.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Promote:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> It isn\u2019t enough to create great content. Most businesses don\u2019t have a large audience that is following their blog closely. So if only a few are reading the content, you won\u2019t be getting many links into it without some form of outreach. Link building is essential to a successful SEO campaign. If you have a piece of content that is a valuable resource, you should contact like-minded websites you feel would find that resource to be valuable as well. Give them the reason why you feel their readers or customers will see value in it, and they may just decide to provide a link back. Another way to promote is through social media. The more people that share your content, the more likely someone will post a link on their website to that content. If you don\u2019t have a large following, you may want to spend a little on <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/social-media-marketing\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">social media advertising<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to boost your social presence.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make the Time:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The hardest thing to do is make time. SEO is not a \u201cset it and forget it\u201d marketing activity. You need to dedicate time each week to achieving your goals. Once you achieve them, make new goals. If you don\u2019t put in the effort, you will find your competition passing you by. If you don\u2019t have the time, you should consider hiring a company that offers <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO services<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See Also: \u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/ecommerce-seo\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ecommerce SEO Best Practices Guide<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See Also:\u00a0 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/amazon-seo\/\">Beginner&#8217;s Guide to Amazon SEO<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See Also: \u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/local-seo-for-multi-location-businesses\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Local SEO for Multi-Location Businesses<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"results\"><span id=\"When_Should_I_Expect_to_See_Results\"><b>When Should I Expect to See Results?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A standard rule of thumb is that you should start to see results within 3 to 6 months of starting an SEO campaign. That does not, however, mean that you will be at the top for all of your keywords. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are several factors that contribute to how quickly you will see success with your SEO campaign:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your Initial Starting Point:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Every website can achieve results, but you need to set reasonable expectations. Every website is unique. Each site will have different content, architecture, and link profiles. A website that was created a few months ago will react very differently compared to one that has years of history behind it. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword Competition:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Not all keywords are created equal. Typically, higher-volume keywords also have the highest level of competition. If you aren\u2019t currently ranking on the first three pages for those competitive head terms, you should expect that it will take a fair amount of time (sometimes longer than a year) to really make headway. Longer-tail keywords tend to have lower levels of competition, but provide upwards of 70% of all organic search traffic. Depending on how established your website and brand is, most websites will reap the biggest benefits on long-tail keywords early on.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO Strategy:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Forming a solid SEO strategy is key to how your website will perform in the search results. The strategy sets the direction for all campaign activities. If executed properly, you should begin to see SEO success building throughout the campaign. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Campaign Investment:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The old saying \u201cyou get back what you put into it\u201d definitely applies to SEO. That is true for both time and money. If you are not dedicating time to search engine optimization activities, you aren\u2019t going to see the results. The same can be said if you are looking for an SEO company to manage the campaign. If you aren\u2019t willing to invest in SEO and are looking for a cheap option, the provider won\u2019t be able to dedicate much time and effort to deliver the results you are looking for. With that being said, some investment is better than no investment. You will have to just adjust your expectations accordingly.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Search_Engine_Algorithm_Updates\"><b>Search Engine Algorithm Updates<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algorithm updates are changes to the evaluation of ranking signals and the way they are applied to the search index to deliver relevant results for search queries. Google makes roughly 500 algorithm updates per year. Of those 500 updates, typically a few would be deemed significant with the vast majority considered to be minor adjustments. Until recently, the major updates were provided names, either by Google or the SEO community. Now, major updates are usually rolled out within the main core algorithm, making it more difficult to determine the true nature of the changes that have been made. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are some of the more well-known algorithm updates over the years:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Panda:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Presenting high-quality content to search users has long been a focus for Google. The Google Panda update was created to reduce the number of low-quality, thin-content pages displayed in their results while rewarding higher quality pages that offer unique, compelling content.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Penguin:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The amount of links pointing to a website plays a very significant role in how well a site will perform in SERPs. With it being such an important ranking factor, link amount was an easy target to be abused by unethical SEOs. To combat link webspam, Google Penguin was released. The purpose of the update is to filter out the spammy, manipulative links while rewarding links that are natural and relevant.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hummingbird:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Google Hummingbird update was a major overhaul of the core algorithm and how Google responded to user queries. This update was focused on providing relevant results based on identifying the user\u2019s intent using Google\u2019s Knowledge Graph and semantic search.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pigeon:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> The Google Pigeon update was focused around improving localized search capabilities. Google strengthened the ranking factors related to proximity and distance of a business to improve results for search queries that have localized intent. For example, if a search user types in \u201cplumber,\u201d the intent is to see plumbers in their particular area, not a list of companies around the country.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">RankBrain:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Google\u2019s algorithm uses artificial intelligence to interpret search queries and deliver results that best match the user\u2019s intent, even though the results may not display content that matches the exact query that was searched. Google continues to use this machine learning to evolve its results as the algorithm learns more about user intent related to queries.<\/span><\/li>\n<li>E-A-T\/Medic Update: Google rolled out a core algorithm update in August of 2018 that was early on coined the &#8220;Medic Update&#8221;, but is also commonly referred to at the E-A-T update as the primary component focuses around expertise, authoritativeness, and trustworthiness. Health and YMYL (Your Money Your Life) related content that wasn&#8217;t clearly written by a reputable author (Doctor, Financial Advisor, etc.), and\/or sites that had very little or a negative online reputation seemed to impacted the most.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Search_Engine_Penalties\"><b>Search Engine Penalties<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two varieties of search engine penalties that a website can receive: manual or algorithmic. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Manual penalties are a result of a Google employee manually reviewing a website and finding optimization tactics that fall outside of Google\u2019s Webmaster Guidelines. With a manual penalty, the business will receive a manual penalty notice within Google Search Console.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Algorithmic penalties are a result of Google\u2019s algorithm finding tactics that they believe are not consistent with compliance of Google\u2019s <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/35769?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Webmaster Guidelines<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. There is no notice that is typically provided with these types of penalties. The most common way a webmaster would determine if they had an issue is by matching updates of traffic\/ranking losses with known Google algorithm updates. As Google has integrated key updates (such as Penguin) within their core algorithm, it has become much more difficult to pinpoint the exact nature of an update. In those instances, there is a heavy reliance on chatter within the SEO community to see if there are common traits shared by sites that have been impacted.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The two most common penalties revolve around two of the more important aspects of Google\u2019s algorithm: content and links. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With Google Panda, sites with very thin or duplicate content see significant drops in rankings, traffic, and indexed pages. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Websites that have a spammy link profile can receive an \u201cunnatural links\u201d penalty within webmaster tools, or be caught within Google\u2019s Penguin algorithm. Sites hit by these have an extremely difficult time ranking well for keywords until they begin the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/google-penalty-recovery\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">penalty recovery<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> process and the offending links have been removed or disavowed.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"hat\"><span id=\"White_Hat_vs_Black_Hat\"><b>White Hat vs. Black Hat<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are two schools of thought when it comes to SEO. One has to do with long-term growth with long-term rewards (White Hat), and the other is to grow as fast as possible while reaping the rewards until you are finally caught breaking the rules (Black Hat).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ethical SEOs employ what are considered White Hat SEO tactics. These SEOs are focused on creating positive experiences with quality content, while building natural links to the website. These tactics stand the test of time and usually experience more positive gains than negative when a Google Algorithm change occurs. These tactics build a solid foundation for sustainable growth in organic traffic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Black Hat SEOs don\u2019t mind violating Google\u2019s guidelines. They are typically focused on improving search rankings quickly to profit off of the organic traffic increase while it lasts. They will use tactics such as purchasing links, creating doorway pages, cloaking, and using spun content. Google eventually detects these tactics and will penalize these websites accordingly, and once they do, Black Hat SEOs usually move on to their next short-term conquest. This is not a tactic that real businesses would want to use, as it can be very detrimental to the future of your online presence and reputation.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"future\"><span id=\"What_is_the_Future_of_Search_Engine_Optimization\"><b>What is the Future of Search Engine Optimization?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The future of SEO will revolve around voice search. This is truly the next frontier that the search engines are working through, and SEOs will need to be ready. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to nationally competitive keywords, obtaining the feature snippet or top ranking for keywords will be very important. You will need to work on making sure that you have content that will answer the questions of search users.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For Local SEO, maintaining consistency in name, address, and phone (NAP) data across the phone directories will be important, but you will need to work on obtaining reviews to standout from the crowd.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">See Also: \u00a0<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/resource\/research\/how-popular-is-voice-search\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How Popular is Voice Search?<\/span><\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"SEO_Consultants\"><b>SEO Consultants<\/b><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If your company has made the determination that you will need to hire a <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">digital marketing agency<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, either for a lack of available time or expertise internally, the evaluation process is very important. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The following are some key areas that you will want to evaluate when choosing an SEO firm:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consultation:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> You don\u2019t want an agency that runs their business like it&#8217;s on autopilot. If they aren\u2019t actively trying to learn about your business or goals, you should eliminate them from consideration. Once you get to the presentation stage, you shouldn\u2019t accept them just emailing over the proposal either. You should be engaged and listen to what is being proposed and any SEO advice that is being offered.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Plan of Action:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When selecting any vendor, you need to believe in what they are going to do for your company. As part of the proposal process, the prospective SEO provider should provide you with a detailed plan of action. This plan should encompass all areas of SEO including on-page, off-page, and how success will be measured. A timeline of SEO activities is also something that most reputable firms will provide.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Quality over Quantity:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some SEO vendors will promise a very large number of links and other deliverables each month. That may be realistic if you are paying several thousands of dollars monthly, but if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Quality work takes time and usually doesn\u2019t come in large quantities.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Case Studies:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Some people say that you should get references, but odds are pretty good that the provider has cherry-picked a list of clients that will have nothing but glowing remarks. Case studies offer much greater value as you can read about real clients, their problems, and how the prospective company produced results for them. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Expertise:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> When it comes to SEO, it is usually better to choose a company that offers it as their primary service. Search optimization is continuously evolving and it is better to be with a company that is in the trenches every day, aware of the latest <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/seo-trends\/\">SEO trends<\/a> and research. You will want to partner with a company that is plugged in. Also, ask about their recognitions and involvement within the SEO community. <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Success Metrics:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Work with a company that talks about metrics other than just rankings. If they are talking about generating sales and leads, they probably aren\u2019t the right fit. They can get you ranking for keywords, but keywords that lead to conversions are where it matters most.<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cost:<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Real search engine optimization takes time and effort. If you are being presented with $199 per month options, you are probably looking in the wrong place for vendors. You don\u2019t have to mortgage everything to purchase SEO services, but you need to have enough of a budget to have actual work performed.
