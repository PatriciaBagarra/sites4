We spend money getting people to our site with hopes they\u2019ll do what we desire them to do and that we\u2019ll learn something about how to improve our digital marketing efforts. While we\u2019ve seen a consistent trend of print spend be allocated to digital spend, we often forget that print is still a channel worth understanding. \u00a0In fact, one study shows that print ads are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.neurosciencemarketing.com\/blog\/articles\/print-vs-digital.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">more likely to engage<\/a> users and prompt action. This begs the question, if print can be a strong channel, why don\u2019t companies invest in it?<\/p>\n<p>The answer is likely because companies are now used to understanding what their dollars are doing. When print, TV and billboards were the primary ad spots, attribution was not an easy task, but today companies have built a habit of understanding how much revenue is generated by their ad spend dollars thanks to the Internet and Google Analytics.<\/p>\n<p>Currently when print ads list the website on the actual ad in the hopes that users will check out the company at home on their desktop, users usually do just that\u2014they\u2019re likely to type it into their browser. This would then mean that the traffic is classified as Direct, which is not a fun traffic source to analyze or understand in Analytics. Or maybe the user does a Google search for the brand and clicks on one of their pages in the search results, which would classify the traffic as Organic Search. Unfortunately, both of these metrics are wrong. The print ad should get the credit for bringing the user to the site. So how can we track these print ads digitally?<\/p>\n<p>To help make sure you can track your print ads digitally in Google Analytics so that you can better analyze the success of your ads, here is the easy four-step process:<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Decide_on_a_vanity_URL\"><strong>Decide on a vanity URL<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Most print ads include a domain name or URL, but if you want to know which website visitors saw this ad you\u2019ll need a vanity URL. Vanity URL\u2019s are unique, short and\/or simple URL that demonstrates the brand or ad campaign. For example if the company EntoBento, a San Diego based dog treat company, ran a promotional ad in Time Magazine, the vanity URL might be \u201centobento.com\/time\u201d. You can learn more about creating a vanity URL here.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Create_and_apply_UTM_parameters_to_the_landing_page_URL_for_the_ad\"><strong>Create and apply UTM parameters to the landing page URL for the ad<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>UTM parameters are tracking codes appended to the end of a URL that allow you to customize your tracking sources. You can use the <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/1033867?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google UTM builder<\/a> to create the tracking URL for the ad in just a few minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Continuing with the previous example, the tracking URL for EntoBento\u2019s ad might look like:<\/p>\n<p><strong>entobento.com\/?utm_source=time%20magazine&amp;utm_medium=print&amp;utm_campaign=promo<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We got this URL by using the UTM builder mentioned above. We simply plugged in the URL of our website and the tool generated this new URL with UTM parameters for us.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Redirect_the_vanity_URL_to_a_URL_with_custom_UTM_parameters\"><strong>Redirect the vanity URL to a URL with custom UTM parameters<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>This part is a little technical. \u00a0A developer will have to create a redirect to send traffic from your vanity URL to the tracking URL. This means, taking the example from above once again: <strong>entobento.com\/time<\/strong> would redirect to <strong>entobento.com\/?utm_source=time%20magazine&amp;utm_medium=print&amp;utm_campaign=promo)<\/strong>.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Check_Google_Analytics_real-time_reports\"><strong>Check Google Analytics real-time reports<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>After the redirect is setup, paste your vanity URL into the browser to test the redirect and that the UTM is working properly. \u00a0Open Google Analytics and navigate to Real-Time reports on the left side. Select traffic sources to confirm you see the tracking. Below is a screenshot of what the report looks like:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/UTM.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-7939\" src=\"\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/UTM.png\" alt=\"UTM\" width=\"963\" height=\"515\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/UTM.png 963w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/UTM-770x412.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/UTM-768x411.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/UTM-748x400.png 748w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 963px) 100vw, 963px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Why_It_Matters_The_Benefit_of_Tracking_Print_Ads_Via_Google_Analytics\"><strong>Why It Matters: The Benefit of Tracking Print Ads Via Google Analytics<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>By implementing print ad tracking you\u2019re reducing the amount of traffic that is wrongly classified as Direct or Organic search and gaining insight into how your different print efforts are working. With this practice you will be beyond most companies who do print advertising with little understanding of how their ad performs.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Extra<\/strong>: This same process can be applied on your business cards, handouts, fliers, billboards, stickers, or your banner at an event \/ tradeshow. Wouldn\u2019t that be interesting to see how much handout traffic you get?\u00a0Or what the bounce rate is on your business cards? Get creative. If your business is using print, don\u2019t be scared to track it digitally.<\/p>\n<p>Do you have experience with tracking print ads through Google Analytics?
