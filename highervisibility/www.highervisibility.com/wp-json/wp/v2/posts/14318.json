That\u2019s because more than <a href=\"https:\/\/videos.brightedge.com\/research-report\/BrightEdge_ChannelReport2019_FINAL.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">half<\/a> of trackable website traffic comes from organic search.<\/p>\n<p>But you might be wondering how you&#8217;re supposed to stand out from the crowd now that everybody and their grandmother is optimizing their websites for search.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, Google&#8217;s frequent search algorithm updates make it difficult to keep up with the best tactics and strategies. And with SEO becoming a standard part of digital marketing strategies for most businesses, competition is fierce.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;re going to help improve your SEO performance for 2021. You&#8217;ll learn several up-to-date best practices for crafting an effective SEO strategy for your business. Use these modern practices to reshape your SEO game and propel your business to the top of the search engine results page.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_Improve_Your_SEO_in_2021_1_Publish_High-Quality_Content\">How to Improve Your SEO in 2021 #1: Publish High-Quality Content<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Content is the backbone of a successful SEO campaign and the heart of on-page SEO. But you can&#8217;t just pop some content on your website and expect it to pay out SEO gold continuously.<\/p>\n<p>You have to update it. Like, a lot.<\/p>\n<p>The reason for that is simple. If you want to drive increased traffic, you have to drive repeat traffic (new and returning visitors).<strong> You have to give people a reason to come back. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>And Google knows this. Regularly-updated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/blogging-best-practices-writing-content-that-will-perform\/\">content<\/a> is essential to scoring big with the world&#8217;s largest search engine.<\/p>\n<p>But the content also has to be good.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When we say quality content, we mean a few things:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Persuasive, engaging writing with no errors.<\/li>\n<li>New and up-to-date information.<\/li>\n<li>Copy that is relevant to your business.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s also a great idea to repurpose old content, updating it as things change in your business and your industry. Just make sure you&#8217;re updating and not repeating. Google hates duplicate content.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_Improve_Your_SEO_in_2021_2_Target_Keywords_People_are_Searching_For\">How to Improve Your SEO in 2021 #2: Target Keywords People are Searching For<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When marketing to your audience, you have to understand how they think, how they shop, and, most importantly, <strong>how they search. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>You should be able to understand what your target demographic is searching for on Google. That way, you can optimize your pages for those specific key terms.<\/p>\n<p>Using an SEO tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.google.com\/intl\/en_uk\/home\/tools\/keyword-planner\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google&#8217;s Keyword Planner<\/a> will show you a list of relevant and high-volume target keywords.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14320\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/keyword-planner.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1386\" height=\"783\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/keyword-planner.png 1386w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/keyword-planner-770x435.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/keyword-planner-708x400.png 708w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/keyword-planner-768x434.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/keyword-planner-75x43.png 75w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1386px) 100vw, 1386px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Of course, much like the quality content you&#8217;ll be writing, the terms that you chase have to be relevant to your business.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_Improve_Your_SEO_in_2021_3_Improve_The_User_Experience\">How to Improve Your SEO in 2021 #3: Improve The User Experience<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Stellar user experience is essential when trying to get your website ranked highly on Google.<\/p>\n<p>Think of it this way. Google is one of the most trusted, known, and respected companies on the planet. When you type a search into Google&#8217;s search engine, you&#8217;re getting a series of recommendations from Google.<\/p>\n<p>If Google&#8217;s number one recommendation was a site that was lacking in content and not user friendly, then Google&#8217;s reputation just took a small hit. That&#8217;s why Google vets the sites that it lists so thoroughly, taking user experience into account.<\/p>\n<p>So, how do you improve your user experience in a way that will impress both Google and your potential customers?<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Write short easy to read paragraphs<\/li>\n<li>Include headers throughout your content to make it easier to skim<\/li>\n<li>Provide images as a visual representation of your content<\/li>\n<li>Increase the speed of your site.

That means the bulk of searches on the largest search engine in existence are done on phones, tablets, and other mobile-ready devices.<\/p>\n<p>According to the social media tool HootSuite, mobile internet use has been <a href=\"https:\/\/datareportal.com\/reports\/digital-2019-global-digital-overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">steadily increasing<\/a> over the last five years.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14321\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/mobile-share-of-internet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"281\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/mobile-share-of-internet.png 500w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/mobile-share-of-internet-75x43.png 75w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/datareportal.com\/reports\/digital-2019-global-digital-overview\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As such, you must optimize your site for mobile users.

A compelling description and meta description also go a long way toward making a user click on your link. You have to draw them in with compelling optimized copy.<\/p>\n<p>The trick is writing compelling content with limited space. You only have 65 characters for your headline. To make it compelling, you need to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make sure it is optimized with keywords. You should have some of your more important keywords toward the front of your titles and descriptions as people tend to skim content.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure that you&#8217;re painting a clear picture about what you do.<\/li>\n<li>Try to appeal to some kind of customer pain point to elicit an emotional response.<\/li>\n<li>You could also always use our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/free-seo-tools\/ctr-tool\/\">CTR Grader<\/a> which tells you what you need to improve to increase CTR.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_Improve_Your_SEO_in_2021_6_Build_Backlinks_to_Your_Site\">How to Improve Your SEO in 2021 #6: Build Backlinks to Your Site<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A backlink is a link featured on another website that links back to yours. It is one of the most critical aspects of Search Engine Optimization, and it is where most SEO campaigns fall apart. Another term for backlinks is inbound links.<\/p>\n<p>A backlink is only useful if it comes from a credible source with good standing on Google. But, it also has to be relevant to your industry. If you&#8217;re a plumber and you get a backlink from a video game review website, it&#8217;s not going to help you.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best ways to create backlinks is to write blog articles about your industry that contain links back to your site and shop those articles around to different sites.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to go about it would be to create linkable assets, something that a person would use as a source when writing an article on your subject. A great example of a linkable asset would be something like an infographic.<\/p>\n<p>You also need to have several internal links on your site. These are links on your site that connect to other pages on your website.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_Improve_Your_SEO_in_2021_7_Demonstrate_Expertise\">How to Improve Your SEO in 2021 #7: Demonstrate Expertise<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Because Google is recommending you to its users, it wants to ensure that you are an expert and that your words have weight and legitimacy.<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s algorithm heavily focuses on an acronym called E-A-T.

One of the most effective ways of showing that you&#8217;re an expert or an authority in your field is by creating blog content.

They can see that an image exists, but they can&#8217;t look at a photo of a firetruck and say, &#8220;that&#8217;s a photo of a firetruck.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s up to us to help them by optimizing images to tell Google&#8217;s bots precisely what is on your page. Every image should have a title tag and an alt tag. This is an opportunity for you to write a brief description of the image, featuring a target keyword or two.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_Improve_Your_SEO_in_2021_9_Incorporate_Other_Media\">How to Improve Your SEO in 2021 #9: Incorporate Other Media<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>You&#8217;re going to need more than just fancy pictures if you want to improve your SEO ranking.
