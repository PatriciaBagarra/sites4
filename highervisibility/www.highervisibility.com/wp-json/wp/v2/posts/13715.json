There is no better way to show that you are an authority in your field than with a regularly-updated blog. A successful blog will drive people to your website and improve your business&#8217; SEO rankings.<\/p>\n<p>While anyone can blog, not everyone succeeds and manages to write blog content that performs on the web.<\/p>\n<p>Is a blog right for your business? How does a business create a successful blog?<\/p>\n<p>Read on to find out.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Should_Your_Business_Blog\">Should Your Business Blog?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Your business should absolutely be blogging. Blogging is a great idea for all businesses, regardless of size or industry.<\/p>\n<p>Why is that?<\/p>\n<p>Blogging is an essential part of the content &amp; digital marketing process. It&#8217;s a crucial part of SEO (search engine optimization), as you&#8217;re going to need a lot of high-quality backlinks to be able to rank in your industry.<\/p>\n<p>Blogging is a one-stop-shop for showcasing expertise in your field and establishing a good SEO ranking. Not only that, it is a content platform that people understand and are familiar with.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t take my word for it. The benefits of blogging are backed by hard numbers:<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13717\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/benefits-of-blogging.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"272\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.nectarmedia.co\/category\/data-and-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>One of the main reasons you should start a blog for your business is because there\u2019s a good chance that your competitors have already done it, and you don&#8217;t want to get left behind.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/contentmarketinginstitute.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/09\/2018-b2b-research-final.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">79% of B2B marketers<\/a> use blogs. The effectiveness of blogging is not a secret. That\u2019s why so many businesses are flocking to the platform.<\/p>\n<p>One of the main reasons that businesses blog is because of the impact blogs have made. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.impactbnd.com\/blogging-statistics-55-reasons-blogging-creates-55-more-traffic\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Blogs are now read by 77% of internet users<\/a>. That\u2019s an overwhelming number.

There are blogs that garner thousands of views, that elevate a business on an SEO level, and attract legions of readers. Then there are the blogs that go almost completely unread.<\/p>\n<p>Usually, these less popular blogs approach content marketing without a plan. It\u2019s not enough to just write down your thoughts and expect people to flock to read your every word. That\u2019s not how blogging works.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So you need a plan. After all, you&#8217;re not alone in this blogging endeavor\u2026<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13718\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blog-posts-published.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"228\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/growthbadger.com\/blog-stats-2019\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>What makes a successful blog? Here are the top 11 reasons.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"1_Successful_blogs_are_informative\">#1. Successful blogs are informative.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Bloggers have to add to the reader\u2019s knowledge and understanding of a subject. If you\u2019re just stating the obvious or going off on unrelated tangents, you\u2019re going to quickly lose reader interest. And once you lose a reader\u2019s interest, they\u2019re not going to come back. The only way for your blog to gain momentum is with repeat readership.<\/p>\n<p>Readers who find your writing informative will share your content and come back for more. In essence, your readers are part of your blog\u2019s marketing department. But they have to be getting something out of the deal as well. That\u2019s where informative content comes into play.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"2_Successful_blogs_focus_on_quality_rather_than_quantity\">#2. Successful blogs focus on quality rather than quantity.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Ignore the word count and focus on the heart of the matter. A reader would rather absorb 2,000 words of quality content instead of suffering through 4,000 words of fluff.<\/p>\n<p>That being said, you also don\u2019t want your blog to be mistaken for a blurb. It should be a simple matter to get 2,000 quality words on any given subject in your field. You don\u2019t want to force length, but you also don\u2019t want to be overly brief.<\/p>\n<p>Get to the heart of the matter and present good information. In food terms, skip the veggies and get into the meat!<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"3_Successful_blogs_have_a_clearly-defined_objective\">#3. Successful blogs have a clearly-defined objective.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You shouldn\u2019t just start a blog for your business and make it up as you go along. Like most ventures worth taking, it is best to do some research so that you can enter into the blogging process with defined goals.<\/p>\n<p>For starters, what are you looking to accomplish through your blog? There are many different reasons why a business might decide to start one. It\u2019s important to embark on this project with your specific goal in mind.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13719 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blogs-have-objective-711x400.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"711\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blogs-have-objective-711x400.png 711w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blogs-have-objective-770x433.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blogs-have-objective-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blogs-have-objective-75x43.png 75w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blogs-have-objective.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 711px) 100vw, 711px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.isitwp.com\/amazing-blogging-stats-facts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>Are you looking to improve your SEO ranking?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Blogging is a great way to do it. Not only does it provide you with additional space to drop in relevant high-value keywords, but guest blogging can help your business generate links on other sites that connect back to you. Guest blogging is the process of posting an informative blog on someone else\u2019s website. It is one of the best ways to increase your backlog portfolio and get Google to notice you.<\/p>\n<p>Blogging also helps with internal linking. That\u2019s another important SEO step. You\u2019ll want to include a few different links throughout your blog to other articles or pages on your website.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Are you looking to increase your <\/strong><strong>social media presence<\/strong><strong>?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That\u2019s another great goal for a blog. Blogs are incredibly shareable, especially if they\u2019re providing good content for your audience. If you\u2019re making valid points, users will share your content with their friends and colleagues on popular social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.<\/p>\n<p>Why do you want that?<\/p>\n<p>More eyes lead to more exposure. More exposure leads to more clicks. More clicks mean more organic traffic and inevitably more sales.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Are you looking to bring in new revenue?<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>That\u2019s something else a blog can do. Create articles that are based around your services, hyping your ability to fulfill the need that the blog has been focusing on. Don\u2019t hype yourself nonstop throughout the article. A simple mention of your capabilities at the beginning and the end are enough. Let your knowledge and expertise do the selling for you throughout the article.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"4_Successful_blogs_develop_a_content_calendar\">#4. Successful blogs develop a content calendar.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>They don\u2019t wing it. You should never be sitting around wondering what kind of blog you\u2019re going to put together this week. You need to have a content calendar completed at least a month in advance.<\/p>\n<p>You should be strategically laying out your content week by week. You can even create little teasers at the end of your articles that hype next week&#8217;s topic. You could do themed months where you dive in deep on a specific topic. But you\u2019re only able to do that if you have a handle on where you\u2019re going.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"5_Successful_blogs_publish_regularly\">#5. Successful blogs publish regularly.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s also important to remember that consistency is key for a successful blog. You want to create a regular schedule and then stick to it if you want your audience to keep coming back for more.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13720\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/impact-of-blogging-on-traffic.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"740\" height=\"371\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.isitwp.com\/amazing-blogging-stats-facts\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re going to be posting three times per week. Your audience comes to know that every Monday, Wednesday and Friday they can expect a new article on your site. People like knowing when content is coming. Your blog can then become a regular part of their week.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13716\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blog-frequency-customer-acquisition.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"418\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blog-frequency-customer-acquisition.png 600w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/blog-frequency-customer-acquisition-574x400.png 574w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.business2community.com\/blogging\/10-unbelievable-statistics-sell-boss-business-blogging-0903221\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"6_Successful_blogs_have_a_clearly-defined_8220voice8221\">#6. Successful blogs have a clearly-defined &#8220;voice.&#8221;<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re going to want to decide your blog&#8217;s voice early on and then stick to it. A lot of that has to do with what audience you\u2019re catering to. You don\u2019t want to dumb things down if you\u2019re dealing with an audience of experts. Conversely, you don\u2019t want to confuse an audience of beginners with a ton of techno-babble and jargon. You need to find a well-defined and natural tone that fits in with the wants and needs of your audience.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"7_Successful_blogs_are_focused_on_value_not_self-aggrandizement\">#7. Successful blogs are focused on value, not self-aggrandizement.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>No one wants to see needless self-promotion at every turn. The most successful blogs pass their articles off as a service in and of themselves. If every other paragraph is an advertisement for your paid services, people are going to realize they\u2019re looking at a 2,000-word ad and navigate away from your site.<\/p>\n<p>You can make your blog feel like a service by establishing expertise in your field. Typically, people are coming to a business blog because they\u2019re looking for information. If you can provide quality information without sounding like an infomercial, you\u2019ll earn their trust and establish a sense of brand loyalty early on.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a dentist. You\u2019ve written a blog entitled \u201cWhat to do When You Break a Crown.\u201d That\u2019s something people will typically be Googling during a trying time. (Namely, after they\u2019ve already broken a crown) By providing this reader with understandable expertise, you\u2019ve established yourself as an authority in the dental field. Chances are, when it comes time to get that crown replaced, the person is going to come to you.<\/p>\n<p>Experience and knowledge are the true sales tools of your blog. Establishing and reinforcing trust in your readers will bring in more business than touting your greatness.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"8_Successful_blogs_are_focused\">#8. Successful blogs are focused.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You\u2019re going to want to find a main focus for your blog. The best blogs are focused on a few key areas, rather than acting as a catch-all for the entire industry.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important that your content remains focused and not fly all over the place. Make sure you\u2019re sticking to your area of expertise. The dentist in our earlier example should stick to oral hygiene and emergency dental situations as the basis for their blog. If they start posting blogs about auto repair, people are just going to be confused.<\/p>\n<p>Outline your niche and stick to it.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"9_Successful_blogs_focus_on_promotion_as_much_as_creation\">#9. Successful blogs focus on promotion as much as creation.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Remember, there\u2019s no point in creating a blog post if no one can find it.<\/p>\n<p>People aren\u2019t going to magically discover your blog because you&#8217;ve published. That\u2019s where social media comes in. Promote your posts on social media for maximum exposure. You might want to try boosting those posts with paid advertising for the first few articles. This will bump up your readership, and hopefully people will keep coming back for more week in and week out.<\/p>\n<p>You should also be promoting your blog on the main page of your website. If you have a newsletter (you should!) include preview snippets in there with a link that readers can follow straight to the full article.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"10_Successful_blogs_are_letter-perfect\">#10. Successful blogs are letter-perfect.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Part of creating quality content is ensuring that your articles are not a grammatical nightmare.<\/p>\n<p>So edit them.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, you should be editing your content up to three times before posting it. You don\u2019t want typos in your work. Your blog posts are meant to show off your knowledge and expertise. Nothing undermines expertise more than glaring typos and spelling mistakes. Invest in a grammar checking service like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.grammarly.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Grammarly<\/a>, which will check your blog articles for any mistakes or unintentional plagiarism.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"11_Successful_blogs_only_share_new_information\">#11. Successful blogs only share new information.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Another thing that successful blogs do is keep content updated with new information. Especially in the digital sector, everything is constantly changing. When that happens, the information that you have on your site becomes outdated. The last thing you want is for people to stumble onto outdated data, as it makes you seem unreliable.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a good idea to consistently go back and update well-performing blogs with new information. It keeps the article up to date and is a great way to repurpose old content and push it out via social media again.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_Conclusion\">In Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Blogging can be one of the most effective tools at a business\u2019s disposal. Creating and marketing consistent content creates an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/local-seo-company\/\">SEO dream scenario<\/a> of guest posting, keyword inclusion, optimized images, and more.<\/p>\n<p>Blogging can also help you improve your reputation in your community. It shows off your unrivaled expertise and impresses your prospects. Blogging is a surefire way to build trust.<\/p>\n<p>The benefits of blogging far outweigh any negatives. Develop a blogging plan with your team and create a dedicated blog platform for your business today.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Contents1 Should Your Business Blog?2 What Makes a Blog Successful?2.1 #1.
