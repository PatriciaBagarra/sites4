Thirty-eight percent said they believe keyword stuffing (which is a negative SEO tactic that could lead to penalties in search rankings rather than improvements) is a good thing.

Bad SEO can cause a website to fail to rank at all.<\/p>\n<p>Two of the tactics that can cause a site to be penalized by a search engine are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Publishing duplicated content (publishing the same content on more than one page of a website)<\/li>\n<li>Keyword stuffing (repeatedly using the same keyword on a webpage)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>While most small business marketers understand these are negative practices, there are still some who believe in these bad habits. <\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>38 percent incorrectly believe keyword stuffing is a good way to rank for a keyword.<\/li>\n<li>12 percent incorrectly believe it\u2019s OK to publish duplicate content that has been copied and pasted from another website or page.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Some small business marketers also have incorrect expectations for how SEO works.
