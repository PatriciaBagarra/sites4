Not only can effective SEO bring you free traffic, but that organic traffic is over <a href=\"https:\/\/hostingtribunal.com\/blog\/affiliate-marketing-stats\/#gref\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">five<\/a> times more likely to convert than paid traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to target the right long-tail keywords. Search engines like Google have their algorithms down to a science. They know what a searcher is looking for, and if your website isn\u2019t it, they aren\u2019t going to show it on the first page of results.<\/p>\n<p>Another great way to boost your SEO is through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/link-building\/\">link building<\/a>. Backlinks show search engines that your website is trustworthy and a leader. This increases your chances of being featured on page one.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re a brick and mortar business, you should keep local SEO in mind. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/advertising-channels\/mobile-marketing\/marketing-guide-holiday-shopping-2016\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">76%<\/a> of individuals who use the \u201cnear me\u201d function on their smartphone visit a related business.

Facebook ads allow you to highly target your audience, so you know that your ads are being shown to the right people.<\/p>\n<p>To generate leads using Facebook ads, you need to first figure out who your target audience is. Facebook allows you to hyper-target your audience, but that\u2019s only valuable if you know who you\u2019re talking to.<\/p>\n<p>The next step is to create an offer your target audience wants. If you can create a free offer they can\u2019t wait to get their hands on, turning them into a lead will be a lot easier.<\/p>\n<p>For example, here\u2019s an example of a company offering ecommerce email templates in exchange for an email address:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13902\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/facebook-ads.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"474\" height=\"663\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/facebook-ads.png 960w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/facebook-ads-358x500.png 358w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/facebook-ads-286x400.png 286w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/facebook-ads-768x1074.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Finally, be sure to direct visitors to an effective landing page that makes it easy and appealing for people to turn over their email address for whatever it is you\u2019re offering.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s the landing page that same company sends their prospective leads to:<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13903\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/landing-page.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1256\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/landing-page.png 2500w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/landing-page-770x387.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/landing-page-796x400.png 796w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/landing-page-768x386.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/landing-page-1536x772.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/landing-page-2048x1029.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2500px) 100vw, 2500px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_Get_More_Leads_5_Generate_leads_with_content_marketing\">How to Get More Leads #5: Generate leads with content marketing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Do you publish blog posts on your website?

If you\u2019re not offering value to your potential customers, they\u2019re going to leave. List and how-to articles are popular and keep people on the page.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure also that the content you\u2019re publishing is the content that your target audience wants to read. If your content is catching people at the wrong part of their buyer journey, then they\u2019re less likely to stick around.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve attracted people to your website using content marketing, you can capture their lead information with the promise of more valuable information. A great way to do this is by offering a content upgrade or a \u201cPart 2\u201d of the content in exchange for their email address.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_Get_More_Leads_6_Generate_leads_by_optimizing_your_calls_to_action\">How to Get More Leads #6: Generate leads by optimizing your calls to action<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t using calls to action on your website, now is the time to start. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol80.com\/blog\/2019-cta-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Research<\/a> shows that in just about every context, using a call to action (CTA) is more likely to get people to take action than an offer without one.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important, however, that you use just one CTA on each page. If visitors have too many options, they&#8217;re likely to take the easiest (leaving). If you give them a single CTA, they\u2019re more likely to act.<\/p>\n<p>One study, for example, showed that emails with a single call to action resulted in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol80.com\/blog\/2019-cta-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">371%<\/a> increase in clicks and a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol80.com\/blog\/2019-cta-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">1617%<\/a> increase in sales.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s talk about the best places to put CTAs. First, include them within each of your blog posts. You can even include the same CTA several times throughout the post.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s an example of a well-placed CTA at the bottom of a blog post:<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13905\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/blog-cta.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"849\" height=\"697\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/blog-cta.png 849w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/blog-cta-609x500.png 609w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/blog-cta-487x400.png 487w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/blog-cta-768x631.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 849px) 100vw, 849px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightorangethread.com\/blog\/view\/blogging-best-practices-calls-to-action-that-convert\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Next, include a CTA in every email you send out. It doesn\u2019t always have to be a link to a product. You can also throw in a link to your latest blog post, or even include a CTA asking people to respond to your email.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, include a CTA in your social media content. People might be inclined to scroll on after reading your latest post. But if you add a CTA, they\u2019re more likely to engage. One study found that including a CTA on Facebook can increase your click-through rate by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.protocol80.com\/blog\/2019-cta-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">285%<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_Get_More_Leads_7_Generate_leads_with_video_content\">How to Get More Leads #7: Generate leads with video content<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>In 2020, it\u2019s clear that video is here to stay. Publishing video content for your business has several serious benefits.<\/p>\n<p>First, video marketing opens you up to entirely different platforms. YouTube is one of the largest search engines out there, and you\u2019ll have access to those searches when you start publishing videos.<\/p>\n<p>But once you get people paying attention to your videos, you\u2019ve got to actually capture the lead.
