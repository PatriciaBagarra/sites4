Will your new website turn up in the search results for any of them?<\/p>\n<p>To make sure that it does, you need to pull out all the stops, optimizing for search engines.<\/p>\n<p>SEO is complex, but very possible and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/affordable-seo-company\/\">affordable<\/a>. Here are six steps to follow for effective new website SEO.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Step_1_Decide_whether_to_DIY_or_outsource_your_new_website_SEO\">Step #1: Decide whether to DIY or outsource your new website SEO<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>SEO isn\u2019t optional. <a href=\"https:\/\/searchengineland.com\/organic-search-responsible-for-53-of-all-site-traffic-paid-15-study-322298\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">53%<\/a> of website traffic comes from organic search. If you\u2019re not attracting those visitors, you\u2019re missing out on a huge source of potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>And your SEO needs to be good. On average, the first Google search result for a keyword has a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/google-first-page-clicks\/374516\/#close\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">28.5%<\/a> click-through rate. By the time you get to the 10th result, the CTR is only 2.5%.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15294\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/google-ctr-ranking.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"508\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/google-ctr-ranking.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/google-ctr-ranking-614x500.png 614w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/google-ctr-ranking-491x400.png 491w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/google-first-page-clicks\/374516\/#close\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>So, how can you get your page to rank as highly as possible? You have two choices: do <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/outsource-seo-services\/\">SEO in-house or outsource<\/a> it.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Pros_and_cons_of_doing_SEO_yourself\">Pros and cons of doing SEO yourself<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The main reason people choose to DIY Search Engine Optimization is cost. There are plenty of changes you can make \u2014 including several discussed in this article \u2014 without paying for expert help.<\/p>\n<p>But SEO is a time-consuming, ongoing process, and you have a lot on your plate already.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, if SEO isn\u2019t your area of expertise, you probably won\u2019t get the results from your hours of effort that an SEO pro would.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t want to skimp on SEO. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.searchenginejournal.com\/digital-marketing-channel-highest-roi\/263757\/#close\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">49%<\/a> of marketers say that organic search is their most profitable channel. To reap those benefits, you need someone who knows what they\u2019re doing.<\/p>\n<p>You could hire an in-house expert, but at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.payscale.com\/research\/US\/Job=Senior_Search_Engine_Optimization_(SEO)_Manager\/Salary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$76,069 per year<\/a> for a senior SEO manager, that tends to be more expensive than working with an agency or freelancer.<\/p>\n<p>Another benefit of going with an SEO agency is that you have access to an entire team of experts rather than just one person.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to outsource your new website SEO, you should still be aware of basic SEO best practices. Discuss them with potential SEO agencies and make sure the company you go with has a plan that addresses each factor.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"Dont_Let_Your_New_Website_Fall_Flat\">Don't Let Your New Website Fall Flat<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped hundreds of businesses launch new websites and achieve their marketing goals.\u00a0 Now it&#8217;s your turn!<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"Step_2_Build_a_strong_foundation_with_technical_SEO\">Step #2: Build a strong foundation with technical SEO<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When you imagine doing new website SEO, you might think about things like optimizing for keywords or creating backlinks.<\/p>\n<p>But SEO starts long before there\u2019s a single word or image on your site.<\/p>\n<p>Technical SEO refers to optimizing a website for crawling, indexing, and visibility. Basically, the nuts and bolts of your site are as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/why-is-seo-important\/\">important to SEO<\/a> as anything you write on its pages.<\/p>\n<p>The technical factors that influence search engine rankings include, but are not limited to:<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Domain_name\">Domain name<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Think about your domain name carefully. Changing it later will be painful and could negatively affect SEO.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your business name dot com <\/strong>is usually the best choice. It supports your branding and is easy to remember.<\/p>\n<p>If that\u2019s not applicable or available, you can try to incorporate some keywords. But be careful\u00a0 \u2014 spammy names like <strong>buy cheap widgets dot com <\/strong>make customers skeptical and are sometimes a poor initial user experience.<\/p>\n<p>If at all possible, choose .com rather than another extension. Google doesn\u2019t rank .coms above other sites, but humans tend to trust them more.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Site_structure_and_architecture\">Site structure and architecture<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Your website should follow a structure that\u2019s logical to both humans and search engines.<\/p>\n<p>The typical structure can be pictured like a pyramid.<\/p>\n<p>Your homepage is on the top. The next level down contains a few of your most important pages. Each of those will lead to a few more pages, and so on.<\/p>\n<p>None of your pages should be orphans. Users should be able to find all of them by clicking links elsewhere on your site. Think about what navigation path would be most intuitive to a potential customer. Google will reward you for being logically organized.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"URL_structure\">URL structure<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Google likes short, simple URLs. Use a keyword that\u2019s relevant to the page\u2019s purpose and avoid things like long strings of numbers or punctuation.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mobile_responsiveness\">Mobile responsiveness<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>These days you can expect that a lot of the visitors to your website will be on mobile devices. Google has moved to mobile-first indexing, which means that your search result rankings are based on the mobile version of your site rather than the desktop version.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, if your mobile site has less content or doesn\u2019t function as well as the desktop site, it will hurt your SEO.<\/p>\n<p>Google\u2019s not the only one that needs your site to be mobile-friendly. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbescontentmarketing\/2019\/03\/01\/5-content-marketing-stats-that-will-help-you-reach-your-audience\/?sh=3fad5a006d8b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">45%<\/a> of consumers noted that they typically abandon any piece of content displaying poorly on the device they are using.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Site_speed\">Site speed<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The visitors to your site are not patient. If page load time slows from one second to 10 seconds, the probability of a mobile site visitor bouncing increases by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/marketing-strategies\/app-and-mobile\/mobile-page-speed-new-industry-benchmarks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">123%<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Google doesn\u2019t like slow sites either. They have specifically stated that site speed is a ranking factor.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15295\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/mobile-speed-improvement.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"304\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/marketing-strategies\/app-and-mobile\/mobile-page-speed-data\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"XML_Sitemap\">XML Sitemap<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>An XML sitemap is a list of the URLs on your website. It helps Google crawl and index your pages.<\/p>\n<p>Submit your sitemap to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools. Your site will be discovered sooner and none of your important pages will be missed.<\/p>\n<p>Whenever you create a new page on your website, plan to add the URL to the sitemap. There are tools that let you do this automatically.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Robotstxt\">Robots.txt<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The robots.txt file lays out the rules for search engine bots. It indicates which parts of a website can be crawled.<\/p>\n<p>You can use the file to prioritize which pages you want Google to index or keep it from crawling internal pages. But if you don\u2019t pay attention to your robots.txt, you could also end up accidentally blocking Google\u2019s access to something important.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Metadata\">Metadata<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Meta tags help search engines classify pages. Make sure that all of your pages have a title tag and meta description and that each image has an alt tag.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Step_3_Do_your_research\">Step #3: Do your research<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>SEO is all about having a plan. Before you create any content for your new website, build an SEO strategy based on keyword and competitive research.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Keyword_research\">Keyword research<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Remember what we said about the first Google result getting most of the clicks? To bring in organic traffic, you\u2019ll have to show up near the top of the page for some keywords.<\/p>\n<p>For the most popular keywords, this is virtually impossible. You could spend years trying to rank for \u201crunning shoes\u201d or \u201cpet supplies\u201d or \u201ccheap flights\u201d and never beat the competition.<\/p>\n<p>What you need to do is identify the right long tail keywords.<\/p>\n<p>Long tail keywords are keywords with a low search volume. This usually means they are more specific. For example, rather than \u201cpet supplies\u201d you might try to rank for a keyword phrase like \u201cpersonalized dog collars\u201d or \u201cnatural reptile bedding.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Most searches are low volume. <a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/long-tail-keywords\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">92.42%<\/a> of keywords get 10 searches per month or fewer. They\u2019re typically much less competitive to rank for, and if you rank for enough of them, you can bring in a lot of traffic.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15296\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/search-demand-curve.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"613\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/search-demand-curve.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/search-demand-curve-509x500.png 509w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/search-demand-curve-407x400.png 407w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/long-tail-keywords\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>You can come up with some keywords manually. Just imagine what a customer might search if they were looking for a specific product or service that you offer. There are also many <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/top-5-free-keyword-research-tools\/\">keyword research tools<\/a> that can help.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a brick and mortar business, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/local-seo-company\/\">local SEO<\/a> is essential. Incorporate your location name or even some local landmarks into your keywords. Think \u201cpet supplies in Minneapolis,\u201d or \u201cpersonalized dog collars in Soho.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Competitor_research\">Competitor research<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Look at the websites of your competitors (the ones you know about and the ones that appear in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/what-is-seo\/\">search engine<\/a> results for your keywords).<\/p>\n<p>What search terms are they targeting and do they rank for them?

After that, you can create blog posts or pages on more specific topics.<\/p>\n<p>There are some best practices for content.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll most likely create each blog post or landing page with a primary keyword in mind. Don\u2019t overuse the target keyword, just write in-depth content that would interest a visitor who searched that term.<\/p>\n<p>The best blog posts for SEO are <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/how-long-should-your-blog-posts-be-faq\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2,100-2,400<\/a> words long.<\/p>\n<p>Keep the reader on your site by including internal links to other content.
