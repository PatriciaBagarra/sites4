Developing a solid ecommerce SEO strategy is critical to landing new customers and loyal buyers.<\/p>\n<p>In this guide, I\u2019ll walk you through the best practices of ecommerce SEO in 2021 to help you rank your products on SERPs and get your brand in front of the customers you want.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s jump in!<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_is_ecommerce_SEO\">What is ecommerce SEO?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Ecommerce SEO \u2014 is it any different than a traditional SEO strategy?<\/p>\n<p>Yes and no.<\/p>\n<p>SEO (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/what-is-seo\/\">Search Engine Optimization<\/a>) is the marketing practice in which you implement a set of best practices to increase your visibility on organic search results.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/why-is-seo-important\/\">goal of SEO<\/a> is to generate more organic traffic and sales for your ecommerce business.<\/p>\n<p>An ecommerce SEO campaign consists of doing the same thing (focusing on organic visits) with the following goals:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>Driving more traffic to your product pages and ecommerce store<\/li>\n<li>Building organic sales that you don\u2019t have to spend ad money to get<\/li>\n<li>Creating better organic brand awareness on keywords\/products<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>You might be thinking something like this: \u201cMy sales are fine, and many people find me organically already. Why do I need to put time and effort into ecommerce SEO?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Well, it\u2019s extremely important to focus on because ranking your product pages or store content on the first page of Google takes work. Lots of it.<\/p>\n<p>If you rank on the second, third, or even fourth page of Google, you won\u2019t generate much traffic (if any at all). Less than <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-ctr-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">1%<\/a> of users ever reach the second page of Google.<\/p>\n<p>Meaning you have to nail the best practices for many ecommerce SEO factors.<\/p>\n<p>If you aren\u2019t doing any SEO but are driving organic traffic, then you are likely shooting far below your potential.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s discuss the best practices to guarantee more sales for your store.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Top_three_ecommerce_SEO_categories\">Top three ecommerce SEO categories<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Just like traditional SEO, ecommerce SEO can be split into three categories:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>On-page: <\/strong>On-page optimization refers to the improvement of your site\u2019s code and content to improve rankings. It&#8217;s called &#8220;on-page&#8221; as the changes you make are visible to visitors.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Off-page: <\/strong>Off-page SEO involves all the activities you perform outside of your site to improve results, such as link building.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Technical: <\/strong>Technical SEO is the practice of optimizing your overall website\u2019s performance to provide a better experience and, thus, increase your rankings.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Some people argue that technical SEO is part of on-page optimization.<\/p>\n<p>In some ways, it is, but technical SEO is a huge practice that involves multiple optimizations, so it\u2019s worth referring to it as a different category.<\/p>\n<p>For the sake of brevity, we\u2019ll focus on the long-hanging fruit of ecommerce SEO: On-page and technical optimization.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s break them down.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"MOST_ECOMMERCE_WEBSITES_STRUGGLE_WITH_GENERATING_CONSISTENT_SALESWE_FIX_THAT\">MOST ECOMMERCE WEBSITES STRUGGLE WITH GENERATING CONSISTENT SALES...WE FIX THAT!<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many ecommerce businesses dramatically increase their online sales. Let us do it for you!<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"What_is_on-page_SEO_in_ecommerce\">What is on-page SEO in ecommerce?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Google can\u2019t read a page like a human does.<\/p>\n<p>When customers visit your ecommerce site, they can easily identify titles, descriptions, images, and videos.<\/p>\n<p>Google doesn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Instead, search engines look at your code and identify \u201cclues\u201d that tell them what your site is about.<\/p>\n<p>If you look at your site\u2019s code, you\u2019ll see a bunch of \u201ctags\u201d that categorize the actual content of your site. These tags help search engines understand your site and match your pages to specific search queries.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, any text between the tag \u201c&lt;title&gt;\u201d will help Google identify a title.<\/p>\n<p>The tag \u201c&lt;a href&gt;\u201d indicates a hyperlink.<\/p>\n<p>On-page SEO is the strategic optimization of this code to rank product pages, category pages, and even your entire ecommerce site for a primary keyword (or a set of keywords).<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s explore the most important best practices for on-page optimization.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ecommerce_title_tags\">Ecommerce title tags<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Your title tag on a given product or category page on your website looks like this in organic search results:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12705\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/title-tag.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"165\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Title tags for ecommerce are the HTML codes that develop clickable titles\/headlines for organic search results.<\/p>\n<p>Title tags serve a few key functions when it comes to SEO impact. Title tags are great for providing relevance and increasing your organic click-through rate by appealing to customers searching for products.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, the title tag above came up after a search for red basketball shoes.<\/p>\n<p>The closer that your title tag relates to the keyword searched, the more likely users are to click.<\/p>\n<p>One company was able to generate a <a href=\"https:\/\/mockingbird.marketing\/case-studies\/on-page-optimization\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">62% increase<\/a> in organic traffic by updating their title tags for SEO.<\/p>\n<p>Title tags are a critical piece of on-page SEO for ecommerce.<\/p>\n<p>Depending on what ecommerce platform you use, you should be able to easily edit your title tag for products, category pages, and more.<\/p>\n<p>For example, on Shopify, you can find this in the search listing preview for your products:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15701\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/shopify-serp-preview.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"483\" height=\"184\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https:\/\/help.shopify.com\/en\/manual\/promoting-marketing\/seo\/adding-keywords\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Image Source)<\/a><\/p>\n<p>So, how do you optimize it?<\/p>\n<p>Here are some best practices to keep in mind when crafting a title tag for your store:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place relevant keywords at the forefront title tags.<\/li>\n<li>Include <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/a-look-at-lsi\/\">LSI keywords<\/a> if applicable\/natural.<\/li>\n<li>Limit your length to 50-60 characters.<\/li>\n<li>Create unique titles for every single product page\/category. Never duplicate.<\/li>\n<li>Consider utilizing your brand name at the end to develop better brand awareness.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Ecommerce_meta_description_tags\">Ecommerce meta description tags<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Like your title tags, a meta description tag is an HTML code that helps explain the content of your page to users on a search engine. Unlike the title tag, you can\u2019t click on the meta description text.<\/p>\n<p>This appears on organic search results as a paragraph description just below the title tag:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13015\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/12\/title-tag.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"623\" height=\"246\" \/><\/p>\n<p>While inserting relevant keywords and context into your meta description is great, it doesn\u2019t directly boost SEO.<\/p>\n<p>So, why is it important? Because it creates the context for the user and helps dramatically increase CTR.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, one brand found a <a href=\"http:\/\/brandnewcopy.com\/on-page-seo-case-study\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">48% increase<\/a> in organic clicks by improving their metadata.<\/p>\n<p>Optimizing your meta description to improve CTR takes testing and great copywriting.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some best practices to follow:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Always include your primary keyword or keyword variations. They show up highlighted in bold to attract more attention.<\/li>\n<li>Focus on compelling descriptions that generate clicks.<\/li>\n<li>Avoid clickbait since it can increase your bounce rate. A high bounce rate is a bad signal that could harm your ranking potential.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Like your title tag, you should be able to edit your meta description where you edit on-page data. The exact location will depend on your platform.<\/p>\n<p>For Example, here\u2019s what the page looks like where you can edit your title tags and meta descriptions with BigCommerce:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15702\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/bigcommerce-meta-description.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"564\" height=\"288\" \/><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/support.bigcommerce.com\/articles\/Public\/SEO-Fields\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Image Source)<\/a><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Search_engine_friendly_URLs\">Search engine friendly URLs<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you search for anything on Google, you\u2019ll likely notice URL strings immediately:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15703\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Picture3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"85\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Why? Because they display a company\u2019s brand name. And since they\u2019re highlighted in green, they draw your attention.<\/p>\n<p>Do they actually make an impact for ecommerce sites? Absolutely.<\/p>\n<p>A poor URL structure is confusing for searchers who are looking for your products and for search engines that are scanning your pages.<\/p>\n<p>For example, when you analyze the following two SERP results, which product category page URL looks more appealing to click?<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12710\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/url-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"632\" height=\"220\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Are you drawn to the first one that\u2019s simple and contains just the keyword, or do you like the long-string URL with dozens of random number combinations?<\/p>\n<p>Probably the first one.<\/p>\n<p>Absolute URLs like the first SERP page are what <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Cm9onOGTgeM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=14m46s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google prefers.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>When optimizing URL structure, platforms like Shopify and BigCommerce even pack tools to streamline the process:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15704\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/web-page-url-settings.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"184\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/support.bigcommerce.com\/articles\/Public\/SEO-Fields\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Image Source)<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Here are some best practices to follow when creating your URL structure:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place your target keyword in the URL.<\/li>\n<li>Keep URLs as short and clean as possible.<\/li>\n<li>Stick with absolute URLs rather than dynamic or date-based URLs.<\/li>\n<li>Consistency is key. Stick with the same format on your entire store.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Categoryproduct_content\">Category\/product content<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Content is king, right? Absolutely.<\/p>\n<p>According to Orbit Media, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.orbitmedia.com\/blog\/blogging-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">more content<\/a> you produce in both B2B and B2C (ecommerce, too), the more results you get.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15705\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/bloggers-more-frequent.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"312\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.orbitmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/10-Bloggers-who-publish-more-frequently-get-better-results-1.jpg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s no secret that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/seo-writing\/\">producing great content<\/a> can help you build everything from brand awareness to real sales for your products.<\/p>\n<p>But when it comes to category pages or product pages, what do you do?<\/p>\n<p>Do you write a long-form blog post? Not necessarily.<\/p>\n<p>Category and product pages are tricky. You don\u2019t want to have thin content and struggle to rank organically, but you don\u2019t want to bombard buyers with tons of writing just for the sake of search engines.<\/p>\n<p>This factor is potentially the most important aspect of optimization on your product pages.<\/p>\n<p>Great product information not only educates the user and fulfills their number-one need, but it also gives search engines context on your page.<\/p>\n<p>You can see one of the best examples of stellar ecommerce product page content from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bolthouse.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bolthouse Farms<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15706\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/blothouse-farms.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"449\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/blothouse-farms.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/blothouse-farms-556x400.png 556w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Keeping the product description short and sweet allows the potential buyer to understand what the product is without reading a full article.<\/p>\n<p>LSI keywords are sprinkled in the description and among the side panel, too, which provides extra context on related searches.<\/p>\n<p>Similarly, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.surfstationstore.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Surf Station<\/a> has stellar category pages:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15707\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/surf-station.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"611\" height=\"496\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/surf-station.png 611w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/surf-station-493x400.png 493w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 611px) 100vw, 611px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Each category page uses visuals to showcase the entire product offering within that category.<\/p>\n<p>A rich description compels you to continue shopping with them.<\/p>\n<p>And potential conversion roadblocks and pain points are demolished by a list of value propositions \u2014 all while containing LSI keywords to capture more topics.<\/p>\n<p>When crafting your own product and category pages, here are some best practices to keep in mind:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prioritize your top product and category pages first. Find your top pages in Google Analytics and make those a priority:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15708\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/GA-pages.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"355\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/GA-pages.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/GA-pages-75x43.png 75w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perform keyword research to find semantic words to sprinkle in your copy with a tool like <a href=\"https:\/\/lsigraph.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">LSIGraph<\/a>. Just plug in your product or category to generate keyword ideas:<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15709\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Picture9.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"585\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Picture9.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Picture9-533x500.png 533w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Picture9-427x400.png 427w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Include your target head keyword as the title of the page.<\/li>\n<li>Optimize meta descriptions.<\/li>\n<li>Keep it short, sweet, and informative. Make it enjoyable to read.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Rich_snippets\">Rich snippets<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Ranking on Google is great, but if people don\u2019t click on your pages, rankings won\u2019t help your ecommerce business that much.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s where rich snippets come in handy.<\/p>\n<p>Rich snippets help search engines better understand your site\u2019s content and display additional information on search results (e.g. star ratings for reviews). They might look like this:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15710\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Picture10.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"596\" height=\"267\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, rich snippets help you stand out in Google\u2019s search results compared to those pages that don\u2019t have them, which can increase your CTRs.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of reviews, there are different types of snippets you can add, including author, item reviewed, ratings, and more.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15711\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Picture11.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"396\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can explore the complete list of review snippets <a href=\"https:\/\/schema.org\/Review\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The question is: How can you add rich snippets to your ecommerce website?<\/p>\n<p>You can do it manually, but you need a bit of coding knowledge.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, Google\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/webmasters\/markup-helper\/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Structured Data Markup Helper<\/a> can help you implement rich snippets more easily.<\/p>\n<p>Simply head over the tool, select \u201cProducts,\u201d and type in the URL of a specific product page.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15712\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Picture12.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"580\" height=\"352\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Then, click on \u201cStart Tagging.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Google will then show a \u201ccopy\u201d of your site.

technical SEO strategy.<\/p>\n<p>What is technical SEO?<\/p>\n<p>In short, technical SEO involves all the aspects of your site\u2019s architecture and servers, as well as how well search engines can crawl and index your site, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Site speed<\/li>\n<li>User experience<\/li>\n<li>Rendering<\/li>\n<li>Website\u2019s size<\/li>\n<li>Duplicate content<\/li>\n<li>Broken links<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And some others.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s explore the main ones.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Website_architecture\">Website architecture<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Your site\u2019s architecture dictates how your content and pages are structured and organized.<\/p>\n<p>This is crucial.<\/p>\n<p>If your pages aren\u2019t properly arranged and structured, search engines might not be able to crawl them and index them correctly.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if customers need to click on seven category pages before accessing a specific product page, search engines may struggle to find it.<\/p>\n<p>Worse yet, that page won&#8217;t get link equity passed down.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15717\"

Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>This is especially important for ecommerce sites with a large catalog.<\/p>\n<p>The rule of thumb is that your domain authority should be concentrated into your product and category pages.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s an example of an optimized ecommerce website structure:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15718\"

Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>As you can see, it only takes four clicks to reach the homepage.<\/p>\n<p>This type of structure comes with several benefits:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Better crawling and indexing: <\/strong>A simpler structure will help search engines crawl and index your pages much faster (and more effectively).<\/li>\n<li><strong>A simplified user experience: <\/strong>Fewer subcategories will help users find specific products in a simple way.<\/li>\n<li><strong>A more concentrated link authority: <\/strong>Reducing the number of \u201clayers\u201d in your site will help you concentrate link authority on your most important pages.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Number_of_pages_in_your_site\">Number of pages in your site<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Number of pages is a huge problem for most ecommerce websites.<\/p>\n<p>Since you\u2019re dealing with dozens, sometimes even hundreds, of products, each requiring a unique page and content, your site can become a complete mess pretty fast.<\/p>\n<p>Dealing with so many pages can create multiple SEO problems:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Duplicate content<\/li>\n<li>Broken links<\/li>\n<li>Abandoned pages<\/li>\n<li>Increased complexity<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The best way to get rid of this problem is by deleting non-performing pages.<\/p>\n<p>If some of your products aren\u2019t selling or people simply don\u2019t find them, there\u2019s no reason why you should keep them.<\/p>\n<p>A quick analysis in Google Analytics can tell you which pages aren\u2019t getting visitors.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter

ecommerce platforms, like Shopify or Bigcommerce, provide you with reports that help you identify products that aren\u2019t selling.<\/p>\n<p>By eliminating these pages, you\u2019ll save yourself from tons of SEO headaches later on.<\/p>\n<p>If for some reason you don\u2019t want to eliminate some pages permanently, you can create a single page containing those products.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Duplicate_content\">Duplicate content<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Since the release of Google Panda back in 2011, duplicate content has become one of the major challenges of ecommerce sites.<\/p>\n<p>Most ecommerce sites use a unique URL for each product and product variation (e.g. size, color, type, etc.), which can create duplicate content.<\/p>\n<p>Also, if you have the same product description on multiple pages, Google may see it as duplicate content, and that can hurt your SEO success.<\/p>\n<p>Now, how can you find duplicate content on your site?<\/p>\n<p>Platforms like Raven Tools and SEMRush can help you spot duplicate content pretty quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Simply enter your website URL into the tool and it will show you a detailed report on your most critical SEO issues, including duplicate content.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15720\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Picture20.png\" alt=\"\"

duplicate pages: <\/strong>Adding a \u201cnoindex\u201d tag to a specific page tells Google to \u201cignore\u201d that page.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Adding a canonical tag: <\/strong>Canonical tags tell

If someone searches on Google for a product, they\u2019ll naturally choose brands they know over brands they aren\u2019t familiar with.<\/p>\n<p>If they haven\u2019t heard of you, you\u2019ll lose the sale to a competitor.<\/p>\n<p>But on Amazon, anything goes. It\u2019s almost as if your brand is an extension of Amazon. Check out the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/670499\/us-amazon-usage-reason\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">top reasons<\/a> why people like to buy from Amazon:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15729\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Picture29.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"607\" height=\"465\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Picture29.png 607w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/08\/Picture29-522x400.png 522w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Didn\u2019t see \u201cbrand\u201d in there, did you?<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re selling on Amazon, the most important factors that go into buying decisions are pricing, reviews, shipping, and Amazon recommendations. Brand recognition is virtually irrelevant.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s wise to have both an ecommerce and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/how-to-optimize-your-amazon-product-listings-2015-edition\/\">Amazon storefront<\/a>. Amazon packs so much traffic and buying power that you can\u2019t ignore it.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose not to have an Amazon presence, you should mimic the benefits of Amazon on products that your competitors are selling on Amazon. Things like free and easy shipping and returns.<\/p>\n<p>If shoppers can\u2019t find similar benefits and they don\u2019t know your brand well, the chances are good that they\u2019ll purchase from your competition on Amazon who likely has good reviews too.<\/p>\n<p>See also: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/amazon-seo\/\">Beginner\u2019s Guide to Amazon SEO<\/a><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Top_ecommerce_platforms_for_SEO\">Top ecommerce platforms for SEO<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When deciding to host an ecommerce store on the web, you have a bunch of different options, and each packs powerful SEO tools to help you boost rankings.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the top <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/ecommerce-website-builders\/\">ecommerce website platforms<\/a> for SEO.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/bigcommerce-seo-best-practices\/\">BigCommerce<\/a>: BC is a top online store platform, and for good reason.
