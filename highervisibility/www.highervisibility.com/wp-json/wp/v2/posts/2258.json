Since search engines now prioritize topic relevance and user experience so highly, no longer will the washed-up, Free-For-All (FFA) backlink practices cut it.<\/p>\n<p>Comment spam is also well on its way out of the\u00a0SEO\u00a0repertoire; following Google\u2019s \u2018do or die\u2019 philosophy is a pain, yet a necessary evil, and the task of exposing your content and\/or website can feel a lot like running in place.

Pinterest is a perfect example of a platform that\u2019s had a lot of success in a short amount of time, and with a tactical approach, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to gather bunch of backlinks, in a short amount of time, while boosting your site\u2019s worth in the process.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re wondering why you should even bother putting together a Pinterest strategy when you already have other social channels, here are <a href=\"http:\/\/expandedramblings.com\/index.php\/pinterest-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">a few compelling facts<\/a>:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>There are 150 million <u>active<\/u> users on Pinterest; 176 million registered users total<\/li>\n<li>55% of U.S. online shoppers pick Pinterest as their favorite social media platform<\/li>\n<li>47% of U.S. online shoppers bought something as a result of a Pinterest recommendation<\/li>\n<li>The half-life of a Pinterest Pin is about 1,600 times longer than a Facebook post<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>I\u2019ve said it before and I\u2019ll say it again: Pinterest is the golden goose of free marketing for businesses. It\u2019s the perfect platform to share content, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/link-building\/\">get backlinks<\/a>, and participate and exist <em>among<\/em> your audience. With the implementation of a few best practices, your business can strategically <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/resource\/guide\/platform-specific-seo-best-practices-guide\/#pinterest\">use a Pinterest presence for SEO<\/a>.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>MOST COMPANIES STRUGGLE WITH GENERATING Quality Backlinks...WE FIX THAT!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped hundreds of businesses improve their Domain Authority through strategic link building.

To generate backlinks on Pinterest, you\u2019ll need to make sure you have appealing, eye-catching images attached to Pins.\n<ul>\n<li>Choose the \u2018create new pin\u2019 option and enter the URL of your website or blog.\u00a0 From there, Pinterest will scan your site and yank all available images (even affiliate banners) for you to choose from. Once you select your image, the page it came from will automatically be appended to the image.\u00a0 Give your image a small description that includes the keyword of the page where the image lands and a direct link to the page. You\u2019ll earn 2 deep backlinks that will bolster the credibility of your site-and that\u2019s just from one Pin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Bad Pinterest Image:<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-9933\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/badpin.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"240\" height=\"785\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/badpin.png 240w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/badpin-153x500.png 153w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2011\/12\/badpin-122x400.png 122w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px\" \/><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Like any social platform, optimizing your profile is an important part of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/link-building\/\">earning high quality backlinks<\/a>. With a half-completed profile, you run the risk of looking fraudulent or lacking in credible. Users should have access to plenty of your business or brand information simply by viewing your profile.\n<ul>\n<li>Start by making sure your username is concise and easy to follow. It should reflect your brand or business and will ultimately serve as your keyword, so make sure it\u2019s congruent with the identity you want to have and maintain on Pinterest. The About, Location, and Website fields should all be filled with your current brand information, and a relevant profile picture should be added as well.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li>The Pinterest boards you have should be a fully functioning archive of links, visuals, and concepts that reflect the values and offerings of your brand. Pins\/Repins from users are nice, but getting a user to follow you depends heavily on the kind of content you populate your boards with.\n<ul>\n<li>Create several well-themed boards and populate them with a diverse array of Pins, both from your site and elsewhere. The goal is to relate to your audience and exist <em>among<\/em> users, so search for keywords that are relevant to your industry and Pin content that your users would want to see and that inspires and complements your brand.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Remember, when used correctly, Pinterest has a lot of potential as a resource. Whether you purchase <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO services<\/a> or do the work yourself, it\u2019s an ideal platform for generating backlink. It\u2019s also a highly trafficked, user-friendly place to position your brand as an authority with your audience.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>MOST COMPANIES STRUGGLE WITH GENERATING Quality Backlinks...WE FIX THAT!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped hundreds of businesses improve their Domain Authority through strategic link building.
