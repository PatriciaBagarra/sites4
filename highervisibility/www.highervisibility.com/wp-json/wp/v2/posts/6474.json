However, what many don\u2019t realize is that Google also has several blogs on the web that are publishing valuable information, in real-time, every few days.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, the official Google Blog isn\u2019t the only one you might want to be reading. Each of the blogs focuses on information for a certain audience. If you ever have a question or want to know what\u2019s happening with Google that may affect your company, you don\u2019t have to wait until the news hits some of the blogs you read regularly\u2014just go right to the source.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Different_Google_Blogs_You_May_Want_to_be_Reading\"><strong>Different Google Blogs You May Want to be Reading<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Below are some of the different Google blogs out there and what they have to offer, going from most to least popular:<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Official_Google_Blog\"><a href=\"http:\/\/googleblog.blogspot.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Official Google Blog<\/a>.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>We have to mention it. This is considered Google\u2019s general blog and is the one where the most significant announcements are made, no matter what department or audience they may appeal to most. This includes insights into their products, technology, and the Google culture.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Webmaster_Central_Blog\"><a href=\"http:\/\/googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Webmaster Central Blog<\/a>.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This blog offers official news on crawling and indexing sites for the Google index. This is potentially the most popular blog out there for Webmasters of any type because it covers all the latest algorithm updates and changes. It\u2019s a great place to come and learn ways to improve your SEO as well as talk with other Webmasters about the latest news.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Google_Developers_Blog\"><a href=\"http:\/\/googledevelopers.blogspot.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Google Developers Blog<\/a>.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This blog offers new insights on Google platforms, tools, and events, and is catered toward developers. Here you will find a lot of tips and news regarding coding, HTML, flash, and other aspects of a developer\u2019s job. If you\u2019re not a developer this can still be a good blog to read for more technical info, but it\u2019s ultimately the most useful for those who understand the specifics of development. After all, it\u2019s written by Google developers.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Google_Apps_Developer_Blog\"><a href=\"http:\/\/googleappsdeveloper.blogspot.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Google Apps Developer Blog<\/a>.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>As you might have guessed, this blog is all about creating apps and different things developers need to know when creating apps. Now that mobile efforts are becoming crucial to a company\u2019s success, app development is exploding. There is quite a bit of news out there on the subject, so this is a good one for all types of company\u2019s to keep their eyes on in the future.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Google_Research_Blog\"><a href=\"http:\/\/googleresearch.blogspot.ca\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Google Research Blog<\/a>.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This blog covers the latest news from research at Google. The content you will read here is actually cross-posted on the Google Apps Developer blog and Google Developers blog in a lot of cases, but it\u2019s still a good place to go if those other two blogs aren\u2019t something that interest you. If you want to know what Google is researching and possible ways that you can get on the ground floor to try whatever they\u2019re working on, this is your blog.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Google_Chrome_Blog\"><a href=\"http:\/\/chrome.blogspot.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Google Chrome Blog<\/a>.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This is one blog that many don\u2019t know about, but it offers the latest news from the Google Chrome team. Subjects you\u2019ll find here include a lot of information about the Chromebook and different features and apps that are added to it each day. Much of the content you\u2019ll find here is also cross-posted on the Google for Education blog.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Google_for_Education_Blog\">The Google for Education Blog.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>According to the tagline, this blog is the official source for information about Google\u2019s education-related efforts. In other words, this is the blog where you\u2019ll hear about some of the latest apps or research being developed for education all the way to blog posts about the winners of the Google Science Fair. If you\u2019re interested in education, this blog will show you some of those lesser-known Google initiatives where you can get involved.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_Official_Google_for_Work_Blog\"><a href=\"http:\/\/googleforwork.blogspot.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Official Google for Work Blog<\/a>.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This blog isn\u2019t nearly as popular as the rest, most likely because its message isn\u2019t quite as clear. The Google for Work Blog seems to cover just about everything that you might need for, well, work. It\u2019s a place for business decision makers to learn about their products and how customers can use them. This includes Google Apps, Chromebooks, and more, so you\u2019ll find a lot of this content cross-posted on some of the other blogs mentioned.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Google_for_Nonprofits_Blog\"><a href=\"http:\/\/googlefornonprofits.blogspot.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google for Nonprofits Blog<\/a>.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>A nonprofit company often functions differently and has different needs and goals than a traditional company. Google has done a great job accommodating with programs such as Google Grants, the YouTube Nonprofit program, and nonprofit apps, which you can learn more about <a href=\"http:\/\/www.seoagency.com\/seo-for-nonprofit-companies\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>. The blog will help give you real-time information about what they\u2019re doing to improve their nonprofit efforts.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"The_YouTube_Official_Blog\"><a href=\"http:\/\/youtube-global.blogspot.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The YouTube Official Blog<\/a>.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Remember that Google does own YouTube, so they have a lot of insider information when it comes to YouTube best practices. Now that video is growing and becoming more crucial to your marketing strategy, keeping up with YouTube changes and advancements (which are frequent) is key, and the blog is a great place to start your research.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Other_Google_Blogs_for_Your_Business\"><strong>Other Google Blogs for Your Business<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The above blogs are just some of the most popular that may be relevant to small businesses looking to improve their online presence, but this is certainly not an extensive list.
