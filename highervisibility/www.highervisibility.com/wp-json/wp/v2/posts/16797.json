For this reason, every marketer\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">top<\/a> priority is finding those leads and keeping the sales pipeline hot.<\/p>\n<p>But lead generation can also be your biggest challenge: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/state-of-marketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">61%<\/a> of marketers say finding new potential customers is one of their company\u2019s number one struggles.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you can\u2019t find the right strategy or don\u2019t have enough time to track down prospective clients, it\u2019s easy to feel like lead generation is a thorn in your side.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where outsourced lead generation comes in. If you want to know more about it and how it can help your B2B or B2C business, keep reading.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Lead_generation_outsourcing_What_is_it\">Lead generation outsourcing: What is it?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Attracting and converting a stranger into your future customer is known as lead generation. In other words, it\u2019s the process of getting someone interested in your company\u2019s products or services through sales and marketing efforts.<\/p>\n<p>With a successful lead generation strategy, you can create a pipeline of qualified leads that will be nurtured until they\u2019re ready to buy.<\/p>\n<p>The key is to always keep that pipeline full of the <i>right <\/i>leads that will eventually become loyal customers.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16799\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lead-generation.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"617\" height=\"228\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/beginner-inbound-lead-generation-guide-ht\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re a B2C or B2B company, you can\u2019t underestimate the importance of generating leads. You can have the most outstanding product or service on the market, but without interested customers, you\u2019re not going to make any sales.<\/p>\n<p>This is why marketers spend <a href=\"https:\/\/www.brighttalk.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">more than half<\/a> of their budget on lead generation.<\/p>\n<p>They know that finding and nurturing potential customers will result in more revenue, brand awareness, and the continued growth and success of their business.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-16800\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/lead-gen-stats.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"578\" height=\"286\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brighttalk.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s only one problem \u2014 it\u2019s not exactly easy.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re struggling with finding the right leads and attracting the attention of potential buyers, you\u2019re not alone.<\/p>\n<p>The marketing landscape is constantly changing. Keeping up with it has been an ongoing challenge for many businesses.<\/p>\n<p>This is why outsourcing your lead generation has become an increasingly popular solution.<\/p>\n<p>Outsourcing means working with a third-party company that will take over the task of finding qualified leads for you, so you can focus on other vital aspects of your business.<\/p>\n<p>However, as a business owner, handing the reins to an outsider isn\u2019t an easy decision. If you\u2019re considering hiring a lead generation service provider, let\u2019s take a look at some of the real benefits that come along with it.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"MOST_BUSINESSES_STRUGGLE_WITH_GENERATING_CONSISTENT_LEADSWE_FIX_THAT\">MOST BUSINESSES STRUGGLE WITH GENERATING CONSISTENT LEADS...WE FIX THAT!<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many businesses dramatically increase their online leads. Let us do it for you!<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"The_benefits_of_outsourcing_your_B2C_or_B2B_lead_generation\">The benefits of outsourcing your B2C or B2B lead generation<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Think of outsourcing as partnering with a trusted expert \u2014 a partnership that comes with several perks.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"1_Lower_costs\">1. Lower costs<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If you\u2019re a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/small-business-website-design\/\">small business<\/a> or startup, you may not have access to the resources needed to hire and train an in-house marketing team that will work on finding sales-qualified leads.<\/p>\n<p>Outsourcing is a simple solution to this problem. You\u2019ll have instant access to a team of already-trained experts whose sole purpose is to find prospective customers.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re unsure about spending money on outsourcing, consider how much it will cost you to do it in-house. Sometimes the long-term benefits of hiring an outsourcing specialist outweigh the costs.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"2_Time-saving_and_effective\">2. Time-saving and effective<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>An outsourcing partner will use their expertise to keep your sales pipeline constantly full of qualified leads, freeing up your own sales team\u2019s valuable time.<\/p>\n<p>Instead of spending hours trying to find new leads, your staff can focus their full attention on converting quality leads into customers.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"3_Lead_Nurturing\">3. Lead Nurturing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Lead generation is hard because <a href=\"https:\/\/databox.com\/lead-nurturing-strategy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">40 to 70%<\/a> of qualified leads aren\u2019t ready to buy yet.<\/p>\n<p>Prospective clients need to be nurtured and build trust with your business before they decide to make their first purchase. If your team doesn\u2019t have the time to focus on this, you can miss out on sales-ready leads.<\/p>\n<p>The right outsourced provider can help with this. They\u2019ll take time to nurture that future client and make sure they are sales-ready before handing them over to your team.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"4_Qualified_leads_that_convert\">4. Qualified leads that convert<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Getting leads is one thing, but getting the <i>right<\/i> leads that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/ecommerce-conversion-rates-in-google-analytics\/\">convert into sales<\/a> is the real goal. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">74%<\/a> of companies say converting leads into customers is their top priority.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16801\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/companie-priorities.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"371\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\n<p>An expert can do just that.
