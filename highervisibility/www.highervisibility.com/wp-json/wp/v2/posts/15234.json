So how can you create a website that gives your small business a competitive edge?<\/p>\n<p>This article will lead you through what you need to know to get started with your small business <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/website-design\/\">web design<\/a> project.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Do_you_need_a_website_for_your_small_business\">Do you need a website for your small business?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>This is a no-brainer: businesses of all sizes need a website.<\/p>\n<p>Surprisingly, only\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/smallbiztrends.com\/2019\/05\/easy-website-maker.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">64%<\/a>\u00a0of small businesses have one. The other 36% are missing out on big benefits. That\u2019s because today\u2019s consumers expect to find every bit of information they need online.<\/p>\n<p>When people are looking for a business like yours \u2014 or if they\u2019ve already heard your name and want more information \u2014 they turn to the internet. A massive\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/local-consumer-review-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">93%<\/a>\u00a0of consumers used the internet to find a local business in the last year.

They had a homepage on their own domain, but customers couldn\u2019t use that page to book rentals.<\/p>\n<p>Their new custom website not only looked great, it provided a superior user experience due to its search and filtering system.

The next step is to decide how to make one.<\/p>\n<p>Do you put it together yourself with a basic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/ecommerce-website-builders\/\">website builder<\/a> or CMS, or do you hire a design company to help?<\/p>\n<p>There are a lot of \u201cfree\u201d or inexpensive website builders out there that will allow you to drag and drop your way to a basic website in no time. They\u2019re tempting to small business owners due to ease and low costs.<\/p>\n<p>But you get what you pay for \u2014 and what you pay might not be nothing.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re likely to discover hidden fees along the way, especially if you want features like a custom domain name or Google Analytics tracking. Additionally, if you ever want to migrate your site off the website builder platform, it might not be possible.<\/p>\n<p>You could also pay for hosting and build your own site with a CMS like WordPress.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll have a greater ability to customize and more control over functionality, but the learning curve is also steeper, even if you\u2019re using one of the many available templates.<\/p>\n<p>Creating the website will inevitably take time \u2014 a precious commodity for a small business.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also important to note that neither a website builder site or a DIY WordPress site can provide you with the kind of SEO expertise that really boosts your website\u2019s visibility.<\/p>\n<p>So that brings us back to hiring a website design agency for a custom web design.<\/p>\n<p>With a professional design team, your website will look beautiful and professional, striking an emotional chord with your intended audience.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15238\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/sonx-therapy.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/sonx-therapy.png 525w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/sonx-therapy-494x400.png 494w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A design agency has the expertise to draw your target audience to the site and give them an ideal user experience. Good agencies will have both a willingness to understand your vision and the skills to bring beautiful designs to life.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_much_does_a_small_business_website_design_cost\">How much does a small business website design cost?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s no simple answer to this question.<\/p>\n<p>If you choose to hire a designer or design agency, a website could cost anywhere from\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/web-design-pricing\/\">$1,000 to more than $100,000<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>It all depends on what you need.<\/p>\n<p>A site with a basic template design and limited functionality won\u2019t cost as much as a huge website with a lot of custom bells and whistles.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be afraid to discuss your vision with a few different agencies. They all have different pricing structures and bring a different mix of skills and styles to the table.<\/p>\n<p>You can expect these factors to impact the cost of a website design at any agency:<\/p>\n<p><strong>The size of the site.\u00a0<\/strong>Self-explanatory \u2014 something with just a few pages will be less expensive than a massive ecommerce website with pages for each product.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The style.\u00a0<\/strong>A pre-made template style will usually cost less than building a custom design from scratch.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your ecommerce platform.\u00a0<\/strong>Equipping your site for ecommerce could cost between $2,000 and $25,000. It would be cheaper to use a third-party system like Shopify, but these typically take a percentage of every sale you make.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Your content management system.\u00a0<\/strong>Having a feature-rich CMS for your site is essential for your ongoing site maintenance, SEO, and content strategy. These platforms have a price range similar to ecommerce systems.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Mobile responsiveness or a dedicated mobile site.\u00a0<\/strong>Designing for multiple device types is no longer optional. A responsive design adapts the website based on the user\u2019s device. If you want a totally separate mobile site, that will be more expensive.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Copywriting.\u00a0<\/strong>Writing optimized on-page copy is labor-intensive. If you outsource this to the website design agency, your site will cost more.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SEO.<\/strong>\u00a0Nothing else matters if no one can find your site. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO services<\/a> can include optimizing technical factors, developing copy, and more. Ideally, you\u2019ll have a plan to continue <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/what-is-seo\/\">search engine optimization<\/a> after your site is up and running.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15239\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/factors-of-web-design-cost.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"534\" height=\"352\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.goodfirms.co\/resources\/web-design-research-small-business\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"MOST_Small_Businesses_STRUGGLE_WITH_Designing_their_Website_WE_FIX_THATSince_2009_we_have_helped_many_small_businesses_design_build_effective_websites_Let_us_do_it_for_you_Schedule_a_Consultation\"><div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"MOST_Small_Businesses_STRUGGLE_WITH_Designing_their_Website_WE_FIX_THAT-2\">MOST Small Businesses STRUGGLE WITH Designing their Website ...WE FIX THAT!<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many small businesses design &amp; build effective websites.

You need one with broad expertise.<\/p>\n<p>Some agencies and designers focus mainly on aesthetics. Looks are important to a customer\u2019s first impression, but they don\u2019t mean much if no one can find your website through an online search.<\/p>\n<p>Other agencies are full of team members who are web developers first and designers second. Unfortunately, a technically advanced website will still turn customers off if it\u2019s not attractive and user-friendly.<\/p>\n<p>Look for a web design agency with skills and real-life experience in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Competitor analysis<\/li>\n<li>Design elements like color scheme, layout, font size, and organization<\/li>\n<li>SEO content development<\/li>\n<li>Optimizing website architecture for both speed and user experience<\/li>\n<li>Driving conversions<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>A good agency will communicate with you to learn about your vision, goals, likes and dislikes. They\u2019ll be able to provide examples of websites they made for small businesses like yours.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Growing_organic_traffic_through_website_design\">Growing organic traffic through website design<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/case-study\/fitness-19\/\">Fitness19<\/a>\u00a0had a disorganized marketing strategy with individual franchise sites that ranked poorly.<\/p>\n<p>HigherVisibility designed a brand new website to improve brand cohesion and search engine optimization.
