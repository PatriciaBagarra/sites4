In considering how you or your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO service<\/a> provider handles your optimization, keep an eye out for these 10 skills.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"1_Critical_Thinking\">1. Critical Thinking<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s important to remember that no two SEO plans are completely alike. Every website is different, and there are many factors that impact a site\u2019s search engine ranking.<\/p>\n<p>Because of that, it\u2019s imperative that an SEO expert should be able to find potential issues on the websites that they work on. This can be done by engaging in competitor research and figuring out what\u2019s working or not working for some of your chief rivals.<\/p>\n<p>SEO success boils down to having the ability to &#8220;out-optimize\u201d your chief competitors. An SEO expert should be a critical thinker; someone who can examine your campaign vs. those of your rivals to determine what went right, what went wrong, why it happened, and how you should go about fixing any problems.<\/p>\n<p>There is no standard SEO formula. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to bring a critical mind to the table in order to understand unique problems from multiple angles and find creative solutions to correct them.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"2_Prioritization\">2. Prioritization<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Prioritization is vital to running a successful SEO campaign. That\u2019s why all SEO experts should have a strong understanding of the steps that need to be taken. Each of these steps should be prioritized as it pertains to their importance and difficulty.<\/p>\n<p>For example, back link building is one of the most time consuming and difficult aspects of the SEO process. It is also one of the most important factors in determining ranking. A backlink is a link to your site from a respected website that is relevant to your industry. Think of it as a recommendation. When a site is linking to your page, it is acknowledging that you are an expert in your field.<\/p>\n<p>Because of the difficulty and importance placed on link building efforts, it\u2019s important to give this process lots of time and attention to ensure that it pays off for you in the end. Simple matters like content tweaks, while still important, take far less time and shouldn\u2019t be prioritized.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"3_Research_Minded\">3. Research Minded<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Research is incredibly important to an SEO campaign. An SEO expert should be someone who mastered the art of researching while still in school and perhaps even enjoyed it on some level. Comfort and confidence are needed for strong research, and make no mistake about it, keyword research is going to take a fair amount of time.<\/p>\n<p>Be thorough and look into every angle when planning out your keywords. SEO experts know the importance of terms that are both high value, meaning that there is a large demand for them, and relevant. Relevancy is huge. If your SEO director is telling you that you should apply keywords that have nothing to do with your product of service, that\u2019s black hat SEO and it will actually hurt your ranking in the long run.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13161\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/research-770x296.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"770\" height=\"296\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/research-770x296.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/research-768x295.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/research-1040x400.png 1040w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/research.png 1919w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>An SEO expert should be well versed in tools like Google\u2019s Keyword Planner. It\u2019s also important to do a lot of research the competition, but be careful not to copy them. What works for one business might not work for another, even if they\u2019re in the same industry.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, and most importantly, SEO experts need to constantly research Google, and stay on top of its ever changing search algorithm. SEO is not something that you just learn once and then never touch again. You have to always be reading articles and paying close attention to what Google is doing. If you fall behind, you\u2019ll lose out on a lot of progress.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"4_Analysis\">4. Analysis<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Analytics are the backbone of SEO. It\u2019s how SEO experts measure success, so it should be a regular part of their day. Every action that is taken during an SEO campaign can and should be measured.<\/p>\n<p>Experts in SEO should understand how to pull analytics as well as how to read and interpret the data that they\u2019re receiving.<\/p>\n<p>But they have to know a lot more than how to simply read the results. Any SEO expert worth the title will know how to take action and apply those analytics to the site that they\u2019re working on in order to achieve continued success.<\/p>\n<p>SEO is a report based process, so any SEO professional who does not have strong analysis skills will be unable to monitor their successes and failures.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"5_Decision_Making\">5. Decision Making<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Throughout the SEO process, you have to make decisions on the go. It is a constantly evolving atmosphere and you can\u2019t always wait to discuss developments in a committee.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, SEO is never a consistent process. Google is constantly changing the way it examines websites and changes have to be made fast, lest you lost the progress you\u2019ve gained. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important that SEO experts have the ability to make decisions quickly.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing how to make the best decision in a given situation without having to ask 10 different people their opinions is a strong quality that all SEO experts should demonstrate. Such a skill only comes from having inside out knowledge of Google\u2019s process, and keeping an ear to the ground to determine when things are changing.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"6_Flexibility\">6. Flexibility<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If a specific strategy that an SEO expert believed would be a sure thing turns out to be a flop, it\u2019s important that they know when it\u2019s time to course correct.<\/p>\n<p>One size does not always fit all with SEO. That means what worked well for other companies won\u2019t necessarily be a slam dunk for another company. Your SEO expert should have the flexibility to switch strategies at a given moment.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, it\u2019s important that these strategy shifts not kill any momentum or slow the process down in any way.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"7_Writing\">7. Writing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Strong writing skills are a must for anyone managing an SEO campaign. Remember, search engine optimization is a content driven strategy, and SEO writing is an art form that not everyone is good at.<\/p>\n<p>It is exceedingly difficult to weave keywords into your content without making it seem forced. There is nothing more painful than reading a blog or information page that has been obviously stuffed to the brim with keywords. Readers see right through it and so does Google. At the end of the day, bad writing may actually hinder your SEO progress.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13162\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/writing-experience-731x500.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"731\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/writing-experience-731x500.png 731w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/writing-experience-768x525.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/writing-experience-585x400.png 585w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/writing-experience.png 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"http:\/\/www.super169.com\/2015\/how-to-write-seo-friendly-articles\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>SEO experts should also understand what kind of content gets clicks in your industry. You have to appeal to both Google and your core audience. What\u2019s the point in drawing people to your site if the content is bad and doesn\u2019t encourage customers to make a purchase?<\/p>\n<p>An SEO specialist also needs to understand how to blog effectively for link building. One of the best ways to get links for your website is to write blogs and shop them around to other relevant sites. These blogs should not be about your service specifically, but rather a general information piece that shows off your expertise and includes a link back to your site.<\/p>\n<p>SEO experts should specialize in writing content for both web pages and blogs, creating titles, writing metadata, and more.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"8_Web_Coding\">8. Web Coding<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While SEO experts don\u2019t have to be web designers, it\u2019s important that they understand the basics of web design and Meta tags. SEO specialists have to be a rare breed of marketing professional with an understanding of how to merge web design and SEO strategy in a way most web designers would not appreciate.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13160\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/web-coding.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"482\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/web-coding.png 500w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/02\/web-coding-415x400.png 415w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/wetlands\/data\/metadata.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re designing a site for SEO purposes, you have to always keep the overall strategy in mind. Designing an SEO compliant site means relying less on artistic vision and more on cold hard data, which flies in the face of what most designers are looking to do.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"9_People_Skills\">9. People Skills<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Having people skills will help an SEO expert in the realm of client communication. Clients ted to get upset because they don\u2019t understand how the SEO process works. This can lead to frustrations and unfair expectations. It\u2019s important that an SEO expert understands how to properly communicate and manage the expectations of their clients so as not to back themselves into an unwinnable situation.<\/p>\n<p>For example, SEO takes time. Most campaigns will go a full six months before any kind of return on investment is seen. If that is not properly communicated to a client, they may become fed up after the first month or two.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t just want to communicate your point effectively; you want to do it in a way that can reassure people that SEO results will happen in time.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"10_Humility\">10. Humility<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As we mentioned before, the world of Search Engine Optimization is constantly changing. Even experts can get left behind if they\u2019re not keeping up with Google\u2019s constant algorithm changes.<\/p>\n<p>Believe it or not, humility is a skill in the SEO world. Some people simply prefer to learn what they can to do their job, then go home and do other things. For an SEO expert, work cannot be something to just \u201cget through.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Being an SEO expert never means knowing everything there is to know about the world of SEO. To think so would be arrogant, and there is no room for ego in SEO. Specialists have to be able to recognize when they\u2019ve made mistakes, accept that certain ideas that they\u2019ve had won\u2019t work, and move along quickly and efficiently without stubbornly dragging their heels through the sand.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Know_What_to_Look_For\">Know What to Look For<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you want to hire an SEO expert to improve your search engine standings, it\u2019s important to know what it is that you\u2019re looking for. You want an individual or company that properly embodies all of these 10 vital tasks.<\/p>\n<p>You need critical minds who understand how to prioritize their actions. You need someone who is heavily research minded that won\u2019t mind the long hours that it takes to compile lists of high-value relevant keywords. It has to be someone who knows how to analyze a website, make decisions on the fly, and is flexible enough to abandon failing strategies at a moment\u2019s notice and adopt an entirely new perspective.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019re looking for a strong writer with a background in web coding, who understands what needs to happen on the back end for SEO to truly succeed. What\u2019s more, your SEO professional should be able to easily explain the process to you and manage your expectations while remaining humble and keeping their ear to the Google ground.<\/p>\n<p>Sometimes it can be difficult to find one person that embodies these specific traits. That\u2019s why it\u2019s often a great idea to employ the services of a full-service SEO marketing firm over bringing in an in house employee to manage your campaign full time. An SEO firm puts an entire team of professionals at your disposal, working together toward one common goal, to push your website up to the first page of Google and to keep it there.<\/p>\n<p>SEO can and does work. Don\u2019t be discouraged by a previous bad experience or a lack of quick progress. Invest in SEO and watch your visibility rise to the top of the world\u2019s most trafficked search engines.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Contents1 1. Critical Thinking2 2.
