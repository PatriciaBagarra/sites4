If your number shows up on social media, a list, or somewhere else easy to find, see if you can get it taken down.<br \/>\n2)Add your phone number to the National Do Not Call Registry.<br \/>\n3)Block scammers\u2019 phone numbers.<br \/>\n4)Use an app or tool to block the calls like some of the following:<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>Have you ever answered a phone call from an unknown number, only to hear a pre-recorded message? These \u201crobocalls\u201d are very common, and most of them are scams. In particular, scammers pretending to work with Google often target small business owners. Keep reading to learn how to stop receiving these annoying, predatory, and illegal calls.<\/p>\n<p><strong>The Real Problem with Robo Sales Calls: They\u2019re Illegal<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A robocall is an automated phone call that plays a recorded message. As technology makes it cheaper and easier for scammers to send these calls out en masse, robocalls are becoming increasingly prevalent. An estimated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/news\/the-switch\/wp\/2017\/03\/23\/the-fcc-is-cracking-down-again-on-illegal-robocalls\/?utm_term=.363c97098291\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">2.4 billion robocalls<\/a> are made every month. Almost everyone with a phone gets them sometimes.<\/p>\n<p>Robocalls aren\u2019t just annoying. They\u2019re illegal, unless you\u2019ve signed up to receive them, and they\u2019re often fraudulent. Most of the time, robocalls are sent out by scammers to scare people into handing over money or personal information.<\/p>\n<p>How? One common scenario is that you receive an automated call from someone who claims to work for or be affiliated with Google. Some of these callers might claim they can improve your site\u2019s ranking if you pay a fee or sign up for their service. Others might say your business listing is about to expire, and offer to renew or manage it for you. There are lots of ways these scammers might try to fish for your credit card number or other personal information, and you shouldn\u2019t fall for any of them.<\/p>\n<p>Even though this type of call isn\u2019t legitimate, many people mistakenly think Google is behind them. This has tarnished Google\u2019s name a bit, and Google has taken steps to fight back. In 2015, <a href=\"http:\/\/searchengineland.com\/google-files-suit-against-seo-firm-accused-of-robocalling-launches-complaint-center-for-users-230796\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google sued Local Lighthouse<\/a>, a California-based SEO company that had been robocalling people and falsely claiming to be affiliated with Google. Google has also published a page with details on how to tell if a call is a scam, and they\u2019ve set up a form where people can submit details about robocalls they\u2019ve received.<\/p>\n<p>Despite all of this, the practice of robocalling is still alive and well. Many of these scammers live overseas and use technology to spoof U.S.-based caller IDs, making them difficult or impossible to track down. It looks like robocallers are going to be around for a while, so what should you do if you find yourself on the line with one?<\/p>\n<p><strong>Identifying a Scam<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>First, make sure the call is a scam. This usually isn\u2019t hard to do. If you\u2019re not sure, there are a few red flags you can look for:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>First, know that Google doesn\u2019t use pre-recorded messages unless you request an automated call from them. Any legitimate, unsolicited call from Google will have a real person on the other end.<\/li>\n<li>It doesn\u2019t cost any money to list your business or manage your listing on Google. Don\u2019t trust anyone who wants to do this for a fee.<\/li>\n<li>Likewise, you can\u2019t pay Google to improve your website\u2019s ranking.<\/li>\n<li>Google will not ask you for personal information like your date of birth or credit card number over the phone. (Nor, for that matter, will any other legitimate company.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><strong>What to Do if a Scammer Calls You<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Of course, you should never give out any personal information over the phone. There are also a few other things you should do (or avoid doing) if you get an automated call from someone claiming to be with Google.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Do not say anything.<\/strong> Just hang up. If you say something, you\u2019ll confirm that there\u2019s a real person on your end of the line, and the scammer will probably try calling you again.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Don\u2019t push any buttons.<\/strong> Some robocallers will tell you to press a number to speak to someone or hang up. Don\u2019t do it \u2013 this will also confirm that you\u2019re a real person.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Report the call to the FTC.<\/strong> Robocalling is illegal if you haven\u2019t signed up to receive the calls. File a complaint with the FTC <a href=\"https:\/\/complaints.donotcall.gov\/complaint\/complaintcheck.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>. Note that you can file a complaint for a robocall even if you\u2019re not currently listed on the National Do Not Call Registry (more on this in a minute). Below is an example of the FTC complaint page for robocalls:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/robocall1.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-10448\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/robocall1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"743\" height=\"543\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/robocall1.png 977w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/robocall1-684x500.png 684w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/robocall1-768x561.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/robocall1-547x400.png 547w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 743px) 100vw, 743px\" \/><\/a><\/li>\n<li><strong> Report the call to Google.<\/strong> You can find the form <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/business\/contact\/rbc_form?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a>.

While you may never be able to get rid of the calls entirely, here are a few things you can do to avoid most of them.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> See if you can find your phone number online.<\/strong> You may never find out where the scammers got ahold of your number, but it\u2019s also possible that your number is somewhere on the internet where anyone can see it. Google your number and see what comes up. If your number shows up on social media, a list, or somewhere else easy to find, see if you can get it taken down.<\/li>\n<li><strong> Add your phone number to the National Do Not Call Registry.<\/strong> The National Do Not Call Registry is a list of phone numbers that telemarketers are not allowed to call. Once your number is on that list, it\u2019s illegal for anyone to pester you. Of course, scammers with questionable business practices may not respect the registry, but it\u2019s a good place to start. At the very least, reputable companies won\u2019t call you anymore.

If you\u2019ve been getting persistent robocalls from the same number, this is probably your best option for stopping them. You may also be able to contact your phone company and report scammers that won\u2019t leave you alone.
