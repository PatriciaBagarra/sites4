Okay, so you don\u2019t have to be overly aggressive about it, but you do have to make sure that you aren\u2019t being nice and letting your competition grab your target audience. A content strategy is going to be the biggest way to set yourself ahead of the rest, and it\u2019s important to continually revise this strategy while directly comparing it to your competition.<\/p>\n<p>A big part of perfecting a strategy is evaluating your content as well as evaluating a competitor\u2019s content, and fortunately it\u2019s pretty easy to do. While worrying about your holiday marketing and traffic is certainly a priority, focusing on your content and keeping an eye on a competitor\u2019s content is something that should always be in forefront of your mind.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Top_Ways_to_Evaluate_Your_Content_vs_a_Competitors_Content\"><strong>Top Ways to Evaluate Your Content vs. a Competitor\u2019s Content<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Keep in mind that evaluating a competitor\u2019s content strategy is not only so you can beat them, but also so you can learn from them. You want to see what is working and what you can apply to your own strategy (so sometimes evaluating a complimentary company\u2019s strategy, as opposed to a competitor, is also beneficial). There are a few different aspects of a content strategy to review:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How does their content performs when it comes to shares across social networks?<\/li>\n<li>What other websites, platforms, etc. are helping expand their content?<\/li>\n<li>What is their most shared content on social media?<\/li>\n<li>How is their content ranking versus your content?<\/li>\n<li>Which content formats are working best?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You will find that collecting this information will rely heavily on different online tools. Understanding all of these different aspects can help you see where you need take your strategy as we enter into the New Year. Below explains how to gather this data:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"Setup_an_alert_to_see_when_your_competitors_are_mentioned_online\"><strong>Setup an alert to see when your competitors are mentioned online.<\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This is always a great first step and an easy first step. It\u2019s not necessarily helping you compare your content vs. a competitor\u2019s content, but it gives you the tools to know what\u2019s happening with their content on their own website as well as around the web. When you setup an alert, each time that company name (or keyword, whichever you\u2019re tracking) is mentioned you will get a notification in your inbox. This will help you know where to go when it comes time to run some comparisons. Below is a screenshot from Google Alerts:<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/ga.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-6629\" src=\"\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/ga.png\" alt=\"ga\" width=\"649\" height=\"609\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/ga.png 975w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/ga-533x500.png 533w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/ga-768x721.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/11\/ga-426x400.png 426w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 649px) 100vw, 649px\" \/><\/a><\/p>\n<p>As a side note, I also recommend subscribing to the company\u2019s blog so that you can get even more notifications about what is published on their blog specifically.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Tools to Use: <\/strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.googlealerts.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Alerts<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.socialmention.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">SocialMention<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/marketing.grader.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Marketing Grader<\/a>.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h3><span id=\"Research_the_backlinks_the_company_is_earning_and_how\"><strong>Research the backlinks the company is earning and how. <\/strong><\/span><\/h3>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Believe it or not, understanding where a competitor is earning backlinks will help you compare content. In many cases companies will actually write their content in a specific way just so they can earn links from certain influencers or other publishers. This will help you see why a competitor might be using certain keywords or certain content forms.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, the biggest reason to monitor competitor backlinks is so you can see if you can earn some similar backlinks, but we\u2019re sticking to content in this article.
