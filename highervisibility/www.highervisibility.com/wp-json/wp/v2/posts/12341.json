There are many benefits your business will get from search engine optimization.

The more often you show up at the top of the search engine results page, the more people click through to your site.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"2_Improved_visibility\">2. Improved visibility<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The more keywords your website ranks for and the higher they rank, the more often your brand is seen by potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>There are a number of SEO tactics that can increase the visibility of your website, such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identifying additional <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/top-5-free-keyword-research-tools\/\">long-tail keywords<\/a> to target<\/li>\n<li>Improving technical SEO<\/li>\n<li>Optimizing metadata on existing pages<\/li>\n<li>Developing new content<\/li>\n<li>Building quality backlinks<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>SEO is a direct driver of improved visibility and impressions in search engine results.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"3_Credibility_and_trust\">3. Credibility and trust<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Websites that appear higher in the search results are viewed as more trustworthy and credible.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, fewer than <a href=\"https:\/\/backlinko.com\/google-ctr-stats\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">1%<\/a> of searchers end up clicking a result on the second page.

Branding<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Unless you\u2019re the FedEx of your industry, your customers probably aren\u2019t typing in your brand name as a search query.<\/p>\n<p>However, if your customers start to notice that your brand is consistently near the top of their searches, it goes a long way toward building brand awareness.<\/p>\n<p>SEO also improves branding by building a better user experience. Potential customers have a better experience when they come to your site and find useful, relevant content. They\u2019re also happier if your site is fast and optimized for mobile.<\/p>\n<p>These things are all part of SEO. When you invest in SEO, visitors to your website develop a positive impression of your brand.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"5_Higher_quality_traffic\">5. Higher quality traffic<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Potential customers are searching for your products or services online. Incorporating SEO lets each page on your website become an entry point for those customers.<\/p>\n<p>Website traffic is considered high quality when it results in more leads and sales.

The more targeted your SEO is, the more likely you are to attract your ideal site visitor.<\/p>\n<p>The beauty of a well-developed SEO strategy is that you\u2019re able to reach potential customers at every stage of the buying funnel, ensuring that you\u2019re their choice when they\u2019re ready to make a decision.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"WHY_NOT_WORK_WITH_THE_2020_SEO_AGENCY_OF_THE_YEAR\">WHY NOT WORK WITH THE 2020 SEO AGENCY OF THE YEAR?<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped hundreds of businesses generate more online leads and sales through SEO.

However, once your efforts start to pay off, you\u2019ll have free traffic coming in for the foreseeable future.<\/p>\n<p>Compare this to an investment in paid ads. They might result in more customers, but once you stop paying for the ads, the benefit will drop off.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"7_Higher_ROI_than_the_other_marketing_channels\">7.

Insight into your customers and who they are<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>SEO analytics involves collecting data for the purpose of improving your organic traffic.<\/p>\n<p>These metrics can tell you more about your website visitors.<\/p>\n<p>Not only can you get demographic, interests, locale, and device information from analytics, but you can obtain a great deal of information about where a user is at in their decision-making process by using Google Search Console to research what keywords are resulting in traffic.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"9_Cost-effective_marketing\">9. Cost-effective marketing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>SEO is one of the most cost-effective forms of digital marketing. That\u2019s because you\u2019re engaging someone once they\u2019ve already taken the action of going to Google and typing in something related to a product or service you\u2019re offering.<\/p>\n<p>When you receive traffic from your efforts on these types of search terms, the users are already interested in what you have to offer. Your job is to convince them that you\u2019re the right partner.<\/p>\n<p>Once you start ranking well for terms, you receive the benefit of consistent traffic that the particular search term provides each and every month, so your flow of potential customers continues. Very few marketing channels can say the same thing.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"10_A_competitive_advantage\">10. A competitive advantage<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/state-of-marketing\/seo-trends\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">63.6%<\/a> of businesses actively invest in SEO.

That\u2019s the only way to compete long-term (unless for some reason people stop using the internet to search, which isn\u2019t going to happen anytime soon!)<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"11_Improved_user_experience_and_usability\">11. Improved user experience and usability<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>When people visit your website, you want them to have a positive experience because it has a direct correlation with their perception of your business.<\/p>\n<p>For any successful SEO campaign, user experience and general usability is a key focal point. Google has made it very clear they reward sites with higher search engine rankings when you provide a better overall experience.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"12_247_lead_generation\">12. 24\/7 lead generation<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The great thing about SEO is that when you\u2019re ranking, you\u2019re constantly visible to potential customers. That means you\u2019re able to receive traffic day and night, which can turn into leads and sales.<\/p>\n<p>If you weren\u2019t doing SEO and had salespeople calling or emailing potential customers instead, you would have lulls. That\u2019s because your salespeople have to sleep, take breaks, take vacations, and so on. A well-run SEO campaign can become a lead and sales generating machine.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"WHY_NOT_WORK_WITH_THE_2020_SEO_AGENCY_OF_THE_YEAR-2\">WHY NOT WORK WITH THE 2020 SEO AGENCY OF THE YEAR?<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped hundreds of businesses generate more online leads and sales through SEO.

A great addition to the marketing mix<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Any successful business has many different marketing channels active at a given time. SEO is a perfect complement to other marketing channels.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if one of your marketing channels is paid search, you\u2019d ideally pair it with SEO so that when a potential customer searches for your offerings, they see two listings.<\/p>\n<p>This way you\u2019re taking up a greater share of the SERP real estate.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"14_Increased_offline_sales\">14. Increased offline sales<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>These days, people even use the internet when they shop in brick-and-mortar stores.<\/p>\n<p>They turn to Google to find local businesses, compare reviews, and check inventory online. And they continue searching while shopping.

Measurable KPIs<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>SEO is highly measurable. Using Google Analytics, you can see the volume of traffic and how that correlates to organic search goals. In addition, you\u2019re able to leverage Google Search Console to see the exact keywords that are driving traffic. This is extremely valuable data that allows your internet marketing team to be even more successful.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15349\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Picture6.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"391\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/how-search-queries-work-on-google-webmaster-tools\/\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"16_Lower_customer_acquisition_cost\">16.

The ability to reach users in all stages of the buying funnel<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Creating content and optimizing that content for various stages in the buying funnel increases the likelihood that you will be chosen when it comes time to make a purchase decision.<\/p>\n<p>You can use SEO to show up for common questions that a user might ask when in the awareness stage. You can also create case studies or other forms of helpful SEO content for the decision stage. Finally, you can create quote pages, coupons, and other sales-focused items that help with the purchasing stage.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"19_Thought_leadership_in_your_industry\">19. Thought leadership in your industry<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Not only does ranking higher in the SERPs instantly make users feel like you are one of the best options, but writing educational content on a continual basis will also position your brand as a thought leader.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"20_A_greater_share_of_the_clicks\">20.

A business that\u2019s actively working on SEO has the ability to control its brand reputation online to some degree.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"22_Local_visibility_for_physical_businesses\">22. Local visibility for physical businesses<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/local-consumer-review-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">93%<\/a> of consumers used the internet to find a local business in the last year. 34% did so every day.<\/p>\n<p>Local SEO is a set of techniques for increasing the visibility of a physical business in its local area. For example, you could target keywords like \u201cparty store in Memphis\u201d or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/local-listings\/\">optimize your Google My Business listing<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15344\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/04\/Picture7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"376\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.brightlocal.com\/research\/local-consumer-review-survey\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>One of the more important ranking factors in your local area is the consistency of your business name, address, and phone number (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/local-listings\/\">NAP data<\/a>) across data aggregators and local directories.<\/p>\n<p>The more conflicting name, address, and phone information that is out on the web about your business, the more difficult it is for Google to know what data to trust.<\/p>\n<p>By doing <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/local-seo-company\/\">local SEO<\/a>, this issue is solved. No matter where your potential customers are, they can find the right information to be able to contact you.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"23_Business_growth_as_global_search_grows\">23. Business growth as global search grows<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The number of Google searches has continued to increase. It\u2019s no wonder the global SEO services market is expected to reach a value of nearly <a href=\"https:\/\/finance.yahoo.com\/news\/global-search-engine-optimization-services-134400480.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$86 billion<\/a> by 2023.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"24_An_ongoing_relationship_with_your_customers\">24. An ongoing relationship with your customers<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>As noted above, if your business offers products or services that users search for online, then they need help finding answers to questions about those products and services.<\/p>\n<p>Creating content to help answer your target audience\u2019s questions helps provide that ongoing relationship with your potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>Publishing content on a regular basis makes you a reliable source of information for your customers while also growing your organic traffic.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15292\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/blog-posts-traffic.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"343\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/marketinginsidergroup.com\/content-marketing\/how-often-should-you-blog-blog-post-frequency-research\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"25_Useful_information\">25. Useful information<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The queries driving traffic to your business provide insight that may influence the types of products and services you offer.<\/p>\n<p>For example, maybe you\u2019re a SaaS business and see that users are coming to your site from the term \u201cfree widgets.\u201d If you\u2019re purely a paid widget service, it might influence the creation of a free tiered plan to gain market share.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"26_A_level_playing_field\">26. A level playing field<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>It\u2019s difficult for businesses to compete against behemoths like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/difficult-outrank-amazon-4-strategies-beat\/\">Amazon<\/a>, but SEO can help even the playing field.<\/p>\n<p>A larger organization has more bureaucracy, while a smaller business can be more agile. Being more agile allows a smaller business to focus on longer tail keywords, user experience, and strategy, whereas a larger organization is typically more boxed in.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"27_The_attention_of_potential_customers\">27. The attention of potential customers<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Only 15% of total traffic for a keyword goes to the paid ads. People are very familiar with Google, and they now understand what is an ad and what isn\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>SEO ensures your brand shows up where the click volume is.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"28_Sustainability\">28. Sustainability<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>If done right, SEO can bring a great deal of sustainability to a business.<\/p>\n<p>When ranking for terms that bring qualified traffic to a website, you are in turn generating leads and sales. Maintaining that position while building new opportunities for your website ensures you have a consistent flow of traffic and allows your business to grow.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"29_Targeted_traffic\">29. Targeted traffic<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The beautiful thing about SEO, as opposed to more traditional forms of marketing, is that you\u2019re able to generate highly targeted traffic.<\/p>\n<p>Having the ability to show up high on the results page for a specific service you offer is gold. A user has actually gone online, typed in something related to your business, and clicked on your listing.<\/p>\n<p>At this point, you have a much more targeted audience than if you were to do TV ads or a direct mail campaign, because they are actively searching for a solution. That\u2019s powerful!<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"30_Local_regional_national_or_global_it_doesnt_matter\">30. Local, regional, national, or global \u2014 it doesn\u2019t matter<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Imagine having to purchase radio or TV ads in all the different markets you offer products or services in. The cost would be outrageous!<\/p>\n<p>With SEO, you have the capability to effectively reach whatever audience you want. No other advertising mediums offer the same combination of affordable, effective options that SEO does.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"In_closing\">In closing<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>There are many other reasons SEO is important and should be considered for most businesses.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you do it yourself or decide to hire a professional <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO service<\/a>, you\u2019ll be sure to experience many of the above benefits.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"WHY_NOT_WORK_WITH_THE_2020_SEO_AGENCY_OF_THE_YEAR-4\">WHY NOT WORK WITH THE 2020 SEO AGENCY OF THE YEAR?<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped hundreds of businesses generate more online leads and sales through SEO.
