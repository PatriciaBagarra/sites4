It is a necessity. It is the backbone of profitability. It is the means by which businesses in all industries remain relevant in a competitive digital marketing world.<\/p>\n<p>You know that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/why-is-seo-important\/\">you need SEO<\/a>, but how do you go about developing and executing an SEO plan?<\/p>\n<p>You can approach the SEO process in one of two ways. You can hire in-house staff to create an SEO strategy and focus on it full time, or you can outsource to a reputable <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO company<\/a> that is staffed with veteran experts.<\/p>\n<p>The question becomes, which path is best for your company? How can you ensure that you\u2019re maximizing your SEO results while still staying within your budget?<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Should_You_Outsource_SEO\">Should You Outsource SEO?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>To outsource or not to outsource. That is the first question that should be asked when embarking upon an SEO journey.<\/p>\n<p>The short answer to that question is yes, you should most definitely be outsourcing SEO rather than hiring an in house specialist to oversee your campaign.<\/p>\n<p>When you look at the dollars and cents of it, the act of bringing on full-time SEO staff is nonsensical with costs going through the roof.<\/p>\n<p>White label SEO providers can do much more for your campaign for much less money. That\u2019s partly because veteran SEO experts are not often seeking full-time work with a company. If they are, they\u2019re making a lot of money to do so.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13388\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/seo-spending.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"319\" \/><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because these SEO experts typically work with a team or on their own as a freelancer. This is a clear case of knowing one\u2019s value in a crowded market. They are an integral part of an industry that will be worth almost <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesagencycouncil\/2019\/02\/12\/is-it-time-to-outsource-seo-heres-what-you-need-to-consider\/#3440bc0348ee\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$80 billion by 2020<\/a>. Because of the demand for highly experienced SEO specialists, these individuals can often make a better living without having to work a 9 to 5 job.<\/p>\n<p>That means that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/seo-specialists\/\">SEO specialists<\/a> you\u2019re going to find that are willing to commit to a full-time schedule are likely new to the industry and just starting to make their name. While that\u2019s all well and good, when it comes to something as important as your SEO score, you want to side with experience. With experience comes efficiency.<\/p>\n<p>SEO veterans are highly skilled at streamlining the optimization process and producing results. At the end of the day, the results are all that matter.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13389\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/senior-seo-manager.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"842\" height=\"214\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/senior-seo-manager.png 842w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/senior-seo-manager-770x196.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/senior-seo-manager-768x195.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 842px) 100vw, 842px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>When you hire an SEO outsourcing company, you\u2019re often doing so for a mere fraction of the price you\u2019d pay to hire someone full time. Remember, full-time staffers need full-time salary. To put that in perspective, the average full-time salary of an in-house SEO specialist is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.payscale.com\/research\/US\/Job=Senior_Search_Engine_Optimization_(SEO)_Manager\/Salary\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">$72,808 per year<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s just the salary for the worker. It does not include the price of actually executing your SEO strategy. Companies usually require at least three full-time SEO specialists working together, so that $72,808 just became $218,424. These employees also require benefits and bonuses if you want to keep a skilled specialist from jumping ship into the arms of a competitor.<\/p>\n<p>At the end of the day, you\u2019re paying hundreds of thousands of dollars for your SEO, where a skilled firm or freelance specialists could give you better results for just a fraction of the cost. Even if you\u2019re paying $15,000-$20,000 per year for SEO, that\u2019s still only a small percentage of the cost you\u2019d endure to have full-time staff.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t pay more to receive less. That\u2019s a simple rule of business that any amateur could tell you. When you outsource, you\u2019re rolling the dice on a much more costly venture.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"Download_Questions_to_Ask_When_Outsourcing_your_SEO\">Download Questions to Ask When Outsourcing your SEO<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Enter your email and instantly get a checklist of the important questions that should be asked.<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><div class=\"frm_forms  with_frm_style frm_style_hv-form-style\" id=\"frm_form_67_container\" >\n<form enctype=\"multipart\/form-data\" method=\"post\" class=\"frm-show-form  frm_pro_form  frm_ajax_submit \" id=\"form_b6plo\"  >\n<div class=\"frm_form_fields \">\n\n<div class=\"frm_fields_container\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"frm_action\" value=\"create\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"form_id\" value=\"67\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"frm_hide_fields_67\" id=\"frm_hide_fields_67\" value=\"\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"form_key\" value=\"b6plo\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item_meta[0]\" value=\"\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" id=\"frm_submit_entry_67\" name=\"frm_submit_entry_67\" value=\"8dd016a78c\" \/><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wp_http_referer\" value=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/13386\" \/><input type=\"email\" id=\"field_crn8o\" name=\"item_meta[1370]\" value=\"\"  placeholder=\"Enter your email\" data-reqmsg=\"Please enter an email address.\" aria-required=\"true\" data-invmsg=\"Please enter a valid email address.\" aria-invalid=\"false\"  \/>\r\n\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item_meta[1374]\" id=\"field_homb3\" value=\"175.176.4.128\"  data-frmval=\"175.176.4.128\" data-invmsg=\"User IP is invalid\"   \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item_meta[1375]\" id=\"field_8ih9a\" value=\"09\/08\/2021 02:21:48\"  data-frmval=\"09\/08\/2021 02:21:48\" data-invmsg=\"Time Stamp is invalid\"   \/>\n\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item_key\" value=\"\" \/>\n\t<input name=\"frm_state\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"wTYNfagm1n2Z5xfePOlBfONjJ3n95gqxJ\/GE8pLbGjo=\" \/><button class=\"frm_button_submit frm_final_submit button primary\" type=\"submit\"   formnovalidate=\"formnovalidate\">Get Your Question Checklist<\/button><\/div>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/form>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"Outsourcing_vs_In-House_SEO\">Outsourcing vs. In-House SEO<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve already determined that outsourcing is a far more cost-effective option as opposed to hiring full-time in-house staffers.<\/p>\n<p>So, why then do people continue to hire full-time staff if it\u2019s such a no brainer?<\/p>\n<p>There are some benefits to having a full-time SEO team working in your office.

There are so many variables at stake, and SEO does not come cheap. You want to make sure that you\u2019re picking the right company with the strongest track record.<\/p>\n<p>You also want to make sure that they are on the up and up and practice white hat SEO.<\/p>\n<p>White hat SEO is the term given to SEO practices that adhere to Google\u2019s algorithm and don\u2019t try to take shortcuts and game the system. The alternative is known as black hat SEO, and it is a series of \u201ccheats\u201d that work well in the short term but ultimately hurt your SEO ranking once Google realizes what\u2019s going on.<\/p>\n<p>Despite the dangers, there are many Black Hat SEO firms which offer reduced pricing for no results. These firms are more concerned with attracting a large volume of clients because of the high rate of turnover they receive.<\/p>\n<p>SEO is a substantial investment, so it stands to reason that you\u2019ll want to make the right choice the first time.<\/p>\n<h4><span id=\"Divided_Attention\">Divided Attention<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>When you\u2019re working with an SEO firm, you\u2019re going to have to live with the fact that you\u2019re not their sole priority. Much like your SEO is only a part of your overall business operation, you\u2019re only one of several clients that this firm is working on.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s where the allure of full-time SEO staffers come into play. You know that you have one to three individuals who are working in the marketing trenches on your site all day every day. That kind of attention is not something you\u2019re going to find when outsourcing.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s important when hiring an SEO firm to understand how much time they\u2019re devoting to you, what they are implementing throughout your content, and what the overall strategy is. Understanding all of this should be enough to soften your anxiety over just how much time and attention your money is buying from your chosen firm.<\/p>\n<h4><span id=\"Transparency\">Transparency<\/span><\/h4>\n<p>When working with an SEO firm it is important that they are as transparent as possible when it comes to reporting. One of the main complaints a lot of businesses have regarding their outsourced SEO campaign is that sometimes it is hard to get their hands on status reports.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that, you\u2019re also often waiting to hear back when you have an inquiry. In this regard, it is hard to compete with the convenience of having full-time SEO specialists on payroll. When you want to know what\u2019s going on with your campaign or you have a question, you can simply walk down the hall and speak to the specialist directly.<\/p>\n<p>There is a lack of control when you\u2019re working with an SEO firm, which is why it is so essential that you trust the firm that you hire. Also, make sure that they have detailed regular reporting for enhanced transparency.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"Download_Questions_to_Ask_When_Outsourcing_your_SEO-3\">Download Questions to Ask When Outsourcing your SEO<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Enter your email and instantly get a checklist of the important questions that should be asked.<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><div class=\"frm_forms  with_frm_style frm_style_hv-form-style\" id=\"frm_form_67_container\" >\n<form enctype=\"multipart\/form-data\" method=\"post\" class=\"frm-show-form  frm_pro_form  frm_ajax_submit \" id=\"form_b6plo\"  >\n<div class=\"frm_form_fields \">\n\n<div class=\"frm_fields_container\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"frm_action\" value=\"create\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"form_id\" value=\"67\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"frm_hide_fields_67\" id=\"frm_hide_fields_67\" value=\"\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"form_key\" value=\"b6plo\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item_meta[0]\" value=\"\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" id=\"frm_submit_entry_67\" name=\"frm_submit_entry_67\" value=\"8dd016a78c\" \/><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wp_http_referer\" value=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/13386\" \/><input type=\"email\" id=\"field_crn8o\" name=\"item_meta[1370]\" value=\"\"  placeholder=\"Enter your email\" data-reqmsg=\"Please enter an email address.\" aria-required=\"true\" data-invmsg=\"Please enter a valid email address.\" aria-invalid=\"false\"  \/>\r\n\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item_meta[1374]\" id=\"field_homb3\" value=\"175.176.4.128\"  data-frmval=\"175.176.4.128\" data-invmsg=\"User IP is invalid\"   \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item_meta[1375]\" id=\"field_8ih9a\" value=\"09\/08\/2021 02:21:48\"  data-frmval=\"09\/08\/2021 02:21:48\" data-invmsg=\"Time Stamp is invalid\"   \/>\n\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item_key\" value=\"\" \/>\n\t<input name=\"frm_state\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"wTYNfagm1n2Z5xfePOlBfONjJ3n95gqxJ\/GE8pLbGjo=\" \/><button class=\"frm_button_submit frm_final_submit button primary\" type=\"submit\"   formnovalidate=\"formnovalidate\">Get Your Question Checklist<\/button><\/div>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/form>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_Outsource_SEO\">How to Outsource SEO<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve decided that outsourced SEO is for you, then there are certain steps you\u2019ll want to take that ensure that you\u2019re not falling into some common SEO traps.<\/p>\n<p>For starters, find a number of reputable SEO firms and interview them. Don\u2019t just go with the first firm that you speak with. It\u2019s good to compare and contrast a few different ones and also do a cost analysis to determine exactly what you\u2019re getting for your money.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13391\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/black-hat-white-hat-seo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"797\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/black-hat-white-hat-seo.png 797w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/black-hat-white-hat-seo-770x386.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/black-hat-white-hat-seo-768x385.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 797px) 100vw, 797px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Make sure that you ask a lot of questions about the SEO process of each firm, as there might be some red flags to watch out for.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s always a good idea to make sure that you have a working understanding of how SEO functions before you start talking with potential firms.<\/p>\n<p>The main step you\u2019ll want to take is to know the difference between white hat and black hat SEO tactics. Remember, if you fall victim to a black hat SEO firm, it will do more harm than good to your SEO, leaving you in a hole that will be difficult (but not impossible) to dig yourself out from.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure you ask them about their link building strategy. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/link-building\/\">Link building<\/a> is one of the most important elements of SEO and it is something that you\u2019ll want to make sure your potential firm understands and succeeds at. Essentially, they have to get highly ranked sites to link back to your page, marking you as an authority in your industry.<\/p>\n<p>Ask them about their overall content strategy. What kind of content are they going to be writing? How will they change up the copy on your existing pages? Will they be writing blogs for you? All of this is incredibly important to know before you write a check, as content writing is essential for SEO success.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure to ask about keyword research. You want to know that the company you\u2019re working with does their homework in determining which keywords they\u2019re out to rank for. The keywords that they target should be both high volume in search quality and relevant to your industry.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13387\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/google-analytics-keywords.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"977\" height=\"626\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/google-analytics-keywords.png 977w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/google-analytics-keywords-770x493.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/google-analytics-keywords-768x492.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/google-analytics-keywords-624x400.png 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>How often do they submit progress reports? Transparency is vital. You have to know how your campaign is doing. If you\u2019re seeing no progress, you have a right to know why and take your business elsewhere. You should also know the process for when you have a question about your campaign. Do you have a dedicated account manager who you can reach out to?<\/p>\n<p>Are they willing to explain their process? If they\u2019re not, that\u2019s a red flag. You want to make sure that they are on the up and up and are practicing white hat SEO. If they\u2019re being cagey about what they\u2019re doing, you might not want to do business with that particular firm.<\/p>\n<p>Is your campaign custom? One of the biggest signs of black hat SEO is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/seo-packages\/\">pre-packaged SEO campaigns<\/a>. SEO is not a one size fits all process. Every campaign has to be custom fit to the company and the website that it is meant to help.<\/p>\n<p>Do they have experience in your industry? All industries have different tactics and different levels of competition. If your SEO firm specializes in improving the sites of others in your industry, that\u2019s a big plus.<\/p>\n<p>Can you talk with past or current clients? Can you see case studies of success? Make sure that the firm you\u2019re dealing with has a history of success. If they don\u2019t want to show you examples or let you talk to other clients, that should be an immediate all-stop.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"Download_Questions_to_Ask_When_Outsourcing_your_SEO-4\">Download Questions to Ask When Outsourcing your SEO<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Enter your email and instantly get a checklist of the important questions that should be asked.<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><div class=\"frm_forms  with_frm_style frm_style_hv-form-style\" id=\"frm_form_67_container\" >\n<form enctype=\"multipart\/form-data\" method=\"post\" class=\"frm-show-form  frm_pro_form  frm_ajax_submit \" id=\"form_b6plo\"  >\n<div class=\"frm_form_fields \">\n\n<div class=\"frm_fields_container\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"frm_action\" value=\"create\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"form_id\" value=\"67\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"frm_hide_fields_67\" id=\"frm_hide_fields_67\" value=\"\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"form_key\" value=\"b6plo\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item_meta[0]\" value=\"\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" id=\"frm_submit_entry_67\" name=\"frm_submit_entry_67\" value=\"8dd016a78c\" \/><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wp_http_referer\" value=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/13386\" \/><input type=\"email\" id=\"field_crn8o\" name=\"item_meta[1370]\" value=\"\"  placeholder=\"Enter your email\" data-reqmsg=\"Please enter an email address.\" aria-required=\"true\" data-invmsg=\"Please enter a valid email address.\" aria-invalid=\"false\"  \/>\r\n\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item_meta[1374]\" id=\"field_homb3\" value=\"175.176.4.128\"  data-frmval=\"175.176.4.128\" data-invmsg=\"User IP is invalid\"   \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item_meta[1375]\" id=\"field_8ih9a\" value=\"09\/08\/2021 02:21:48\"  data-frmval=\"09\/08\/2021 02:21:48\" data-invmsg=\"Time Stamp is invalid\"   \/>\n\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item_key\" value=\"\" \/>\n\t<input name=\"frm_state\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"wTYNfagm1n2Z5xfePOlBfONjJ3n95gqxJ\/GE8pLbGjo=\" \/><button class=\"frm_button_submit frm_final_submit button primary\" type=\"submit\"   formnovalidate=\"formnovalidate\">Get Your Question Checklist<\/button><\/div>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/form>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The best way to get the most bang for your SEO buck is to outsource the process to a reputable SEO firm or freelance operation.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, you\u2019ll be giving up some control over the process, but if you make your selection wisely you will invest far less and achieve far more than you would by entrusting in-house SEO staff members.
