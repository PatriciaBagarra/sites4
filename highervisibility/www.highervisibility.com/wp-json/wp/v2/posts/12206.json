Will earning one help you achieve your career goals?<\/p>\n<p>The short answer: it depends.<\/p>\n<p>Certifications aren\u2019t always necessary to work in SEO. In fact, many SEO experts manage just fine without ever earning a certification. But taking an online course can be helpful in some situations.<\/p>\n<p>Read on to discover the best SEO certifications and to learn when you should (and shouldn\u2019t) consider earning one.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_purpose_of_certifications\">The purpose of certifications<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Earning an SEO certification can serve multiple purposes.<\/p>\n<p>First, getting certified creates official documentation of your learning.<\/p>\n<p>Anybody can claim that they\u2019re an SEO specialist, no matter what their actual skill level is. Earning a certification gives you a way to back up your claims.<\/p>\n<p>In a field like SEO, where many people are self-taught, this can be very helpful in getting employers to sit up and take notice of you.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16791\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/hubspot-cert.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"483\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/hubspot-cert.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/hubspot-cert-517x400.png 517w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/seo-certification\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Earning some certifications can also help you fill out your resume.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve just launched your SEO career and don\u2019t have a lot of real-world experience to add, certifications can help you get a foothold in the field and land that first job.<\/p>\n<p>Earning certifications as a newcomer doesn\u2019t just highlight the skills you\u2019ve worked on. It also shows that you\u2019re committed to learning and able to follow through on what you start.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, some employers prefer to hire people who have certain qualifications.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re shooting for a job that favors applicants with specific knowledge, earning a certification in that subject can give you a leg up over your competition. Some employers even require their employees to earn certifications as a form of training.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Do_certifications_make_you_an_expert\">Do certifications make you an expert?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>SEO certifications can be useful. But if you\u2019re currently a beginner, can getting certified make you an SEO expert?<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the answer is no.<\/p>\n<p>Certifications can only teach you so much because true SEO mastery comes from doing hands-on work.<\/p>\n<p>You can learn important SEO concepts by earning an online certification, but knowing how and when to apply those principles can only come from experience and practice. Think of certifications as a starting point, not as the culmination of your learning.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16793\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/click-minded-cert.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"483\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/click-minded-cert.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/click-minded-cert-517x400.png 517w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.clickminded.com\/seo-certification\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Taking an SEO course isn\u2019t guaranteed to land you a job, either.<\/p>\n<p>Some people cheat on their certification tests, which makes many employers wary of trusting these credentials. Employers also prefer to hire experienced specialists who show real-world results in the field, regardless of their qualifications on paper.<\/p>\n<p>None of this necessarily means that you shouldn\u2019t earn a certification. If you have gaps in your knowledge or weaknesses that you\u2019d like to fix, SEO training can help you even out your profile of strengths.<\/p>\n<p>Taking an SEO training course can also be a good choice if you like structured learning environments. However, if your goal is to impress employers or become an SEO expert, certifications are only part of the whole picture.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"SEO_certifications_and_courses_you_may_want_to_consider\">SEO certifications and courses you may want to consider<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Do you think earning a certification might be helpful for you?
