But it also takes time. Often, it can take more than six months before you start to see a return on your investment.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, there\u2019s a more immediate option that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/why-are-you-choosing-between-seo-ppc-when-they-can-work-together\/\">can work on its own or alongside SEO<\/a> \u2014 pay-per-click advertising.<\/p>\n<p>With PPC, you can get instant results on the world\u2019s most popular search engine. As soon as you activate your campaign, you\u2019ll see traffic heading to your site.<\/p>\n<p>If this sounds too good to be true, fear not. PPC is very real and very doable.<\/p>\n<p>But what does it cost?<\/p>\n<p>The most honest answer you can get to this question is, \u201cIt depends.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not a cop-out.<\/p>\n<p>As the advertiser, you\u2019re in control of PPC pricing. It\u2019s based on your chosen budget and target keywords.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Whats_PPC\">What\u2019s PPC?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>PPC advertising is precisely what it sounds like. It is a form of advertising in which you pay per click that you receive. There are many different types of PPC ads, but most campaigns run through Google Ads.<\/p>\n<p>The way it works is simple.<\/p>\n<p>Your listing is displayed to Google users who type in the keywords you\u2019ve chosen for your ad campaign. These ads are listed before the organic results on a search engine results page (SERP) or appear on Google\u2019s vast display network.<\/p>\n<p>If a viewer clicks on your ad, you pay.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13846\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/ppc-ads.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"801\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/ppc-ads.png 1000w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/ppc-ads-624x500.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/ppc-ads-499x400.png 499w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/ppc-ads-768x615.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Just choose the keywords you want and set a maximum bid for how much you are willing to pay per click. Then, the highest bid with the best ad appears at the top of the results.<\/p>\n<p>You can expect to pay more for popular keywords. However, for less competitive keywords, you might only spend a few cents.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s all dependent on the kind of competition you\u2019re facing.<\/p>\n<p>You can also customize both when and where your ads appear.<\/p>\n<p>If you know that your audience is typically online and searching at a specific time of day, you can have your ads appear primarily during that period. You can also zero in on specific geographic locations.<\/p>\n<p>Use Google Analytics to learn about your target audience\u2019s behavior and switch on conversion tracking on Google Ads to learn more about how your audience responds to your ads.<\/p>\n<p>This helps you refine your PPC campaign to reach your target audience more effectively.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_does_PPC_placement_work\">How does PPC placement work?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The maximum bid for your keywords isn\u2019t the only determining factor in deciding your placement.<\/p>\n<p>Google also assigns every listing with a Quality Score (QS).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13847\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/quality-score.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1504\" height=\"898\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/quality-score.png 1504w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/quality-score-770x460.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/quality-score-670x400.png 670w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/quality-score-768x459.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1504px) 100vw, 1504px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/blog.tryadhawk.com\/google-adwords\/how-google-adwords-works\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>The QS is determined by the ad&#8217;s relevance to your chosen keyword, the click-through rate of the ad, and the quality of the landing page the ad points to.<\/p>\n<p>Placement is determined by your maximum bid times your quality score.<\/p>\n<p>For example:<\/p>\n<p>A $5 maximum bid with a QS of 10 gives you an Ad rank of 50.<\/p>\n<p>The top ad rank is featured on the top in a search network result.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s essential to create quality ads because a high QS could lead to a lower ad spend.

You should run Google text and banner ads as well as remarketing. Remarketing is when your ads are shown to people who have been to your site in the past.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also a good idea to run display ads on the Google network, as these will be featured on industry-relevant websites.<\/p>\n<p>You could also run YouTube video ads under a basic plan.

You don\u2019t want to duplicate what your competitors are doing from a PPC standpoint \u2014 you want to exceed it.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Campaign_development_and_strategy\">Campaign development and strategy<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>PPC needs a strategy. Your PPC firm will come up with a strategic plan to increase your brand reach among your target audience.<\/p>\n<p>This mostly has to do with audience targeting because it is the <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hubfs\/53\/tools\/state-of-marketing\/PDFs\/Not%20Another%20State%20of%20Marketing%20Report%20-%20Web%20Version.pdf?__hstc=20629287.6881370f4b5d085c54f751a0bdf491e2.1591271880729.1600766078799.1600775988550.85&amp;__hssc=20629287.1.1600775988550&amp;__hsfp=2984105070\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">top strategy<\/a> used to optimize PPC ads.

It\u2019s an essential step in learning what your audience is searching for.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Ad_copywriting\">Ad copywriting<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Your ads need compelling copy.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you\u2019re the number one result on the search network, you\u2019re still competing with several other ads.<\/p>\n<p>Your ad copy has to pull the user in and make them want to click on you over your competitors. PPC agencies know what it takes to create ads that convert.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Performance_testing\">Performance testing<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You have to know how you\u2019re doing \u2014 both good and bad \u2014 during a PPC campaign.<\/p>\n<p>The agency will continuously check on the progress of your ads to determine if they\u2019re succeeding or failing.

You have to know when that happens if you\u2019re going to stay on top.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Google_analytics_integration\">Google analytics integration<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Using Google Analytics is a great way to track the success of your ad campaign.<\/p>\n<p>Google Ads can only tell you so much about the behavior of your target audience. Google Analytics will help give you a detailed picture of how your website visitors interact with your content, helping you shape your ads to meet those needs.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, Google Analytics makes it easier to filter data.<\/p>\n<p>While Google Ads will provide you with reports, Google Analytics makes it easier to understand the relevance of those reports and how to use them to improve your campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>The agency will integrate Analytics into your site and use it to measure your success.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Goal_tracking\">Goal tracking<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>In the beginning, you should talk with the agency about your specific goals. What are you hoping to accomplish in terms of new clients or profits through this campaign?<\/p>\n<p>The agency will keep track of those goals, letting you know what has to be done to meet or exceed them.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Strategic_management_of_bids\">Strategic management of bids<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Bid management is strategic and takes a lot of time and effort.<\/p>\n<p>The bid management strategy that you choose will determine the type of engagement you get from your target audience. In fact, bid strategy testing is one of the top <a href=\"https:\/\/cdn2.hubspot.net\/hubfs\/53\/tools\/state-of-marketing\/PDFs\/Not%20Another%20State%20of%20Marketing%20Report%20-%20Web%20Version.pdf?__hstc=20629287.6881370f4b5d085c54f751a0bdf491e2.1591271880729.1600766078799.1600775988550.85&amp;__hssc=20629287.1.1600775988550&amp;__hsfp=2984105070\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">10<\/a> techniques for refining PPC ads.<\/p>\n<p>The agency deals with this, working within the confines of your established budget to make sure that you\u2019re getting the most penetration possible.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Analysis_and_reporting_of_results\">Analysis and reporting of results<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You need to know how your campaign is doing. After all, it\u2019s your money.<\/p>\n<p>The agency shouldn\u2019t only provide you with reports every month. They should also take the time to break down this data and explain its relevance.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_does_a_moderate_PPC_campaign_cost\">What does a moderate PPC campaign cost?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A moderate PPC campaign should have a monthly ad spend between $2,500\u2013$12,000. It usually features up to 2,000 keywords in the campaign.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re creating a more expanded campaign, it\u2019s usually a good idea to run ads in both the Google and Bing Ads networks. While Google is a much more extensive network, it doesn\u2019t hurt to cast a bigger net.<\/p>\n<p>A moderate campaign includes everything involved in a basic PPC campaign.<\/p>\n<p>It also comes with additional monitoring of clicks and conversions while checking for fraudulent activity at the same time.<\/p>\n<p>The agency sets up and manages rule-based bidding, where the bid examines each keyword independently, rather than looking at how they might work together.<\/p>\n<p>For a moderate PPC campaign, an agency will typically charge a setup fee in the first month of $1,750.<\/p>\n<p>It would then be around 15% of the monthly ad spend, with a minimum of $500.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_does_an_aggressive_PPC_campaign_cost\">What does an aggressive PPC campaign cost?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>An aggressive PPC campaign is generally considered to be a monthly spend of $12,00\u2013 $50,000. It includes up to 10,000 keywords and is conducted on both the Google AdWords and Bing Ads networks.<\/p>\n<p>An aggressive PPC campaign involves everything included in the above levels but adds international management. That\u2019s ideal for companies that do business outside the U.S.<\/p>\n<p>This level should also include some form of landing page creation and conversion rate analysis as well.<\/p>\n<p>An agency-managed campaign at this level should also include graphic design of visual content. You should include at least one set of banner ad designs for display and remarketing campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Something like this is generally going to run a $2,500 one-time setup fee. After that, you\u2019re looking at a base monthly price of 12% of your monthly ad spend, with a minimum of $1,800.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_much_does_PPC_retargeting_cost\">How much does PPC retargeting cost?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Retargeting involves showing your ads to people who have visited your site and left without making a purchase.<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever noticed that once you visit a website, you start to see ads for that brand popping up all over the place?<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not a coincidence. It\u2019s retargeting at work.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13851\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/03\/ppc-retargeting-cost.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"632\" height=\"300\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/google-remarketing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>When you dig down into the visitor metrics, most websites tend to have a high bounce rate, with <a href=\"https:\/\/go.contentsquare.com\/hubfs\/eBooks\/2020%20Digital%20Experience%20Benchmark\/2020%20Digital%20Experience%20Benchmark%20Report%20PDF%20English.pdf?hsLang=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">47%<\/a> of visitors clicking off your site after a few seconds.<\/p>\n<p>What\u2019s more, even though shoppers tend to pile up their online carts, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freshrelevance.com\/resources\/real-time-marketing-report-for-q3-2020\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">60%<\/a> of purchases are never completed.<\/p>\n<p>Retargeting gives you a second chance to get in front of the customers that drop off to try and win them back.<\/p>\n<p>Retargeting can be a great way to lure back prospects who initially showed some interest in your company but didn\u2019t convert for one reason or another.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, you\u2019re targeting customers who have already shown an interest in your brand, which can help to reduce advertising costs by improving return on investment. Rather than trying to convince a brand-new prospect, these potential customers are already on their way to buying.<\/p>\n<p>This is why <a href=\"https:\/\/www.criteo.com\/state-of-digital-advertising-report-2021\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">40%<\/a> of marketers are looking to increase their retargeting budget to optimize the overall efficiency of their paid ad campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>All levels of PPC management services should include retargeting efforts for you.<\/p>\n<p>But how much of your budget should be allocated to retargeting?<\/p>\n<p>The cost of remarketing varies based on industry, much as we discussed earlier. If you have a ton of competition, you\u2019re going to be paying a lot for every click. However, companies with light to moderate competition will usually see somewhere between $0.66\u2013$1.23 per click.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>PPC is a great way to get your website out there using both the Google display and search networks.<\/p>\n<p>By setting a reasonable bid budget and creating quality PPC ads, you\u2019re more likely to succeed and gain more clicks.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to entrust your PPC digital marketing to a skilled agency staffed with pay-per-click marketing professionals.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you know what average PPC pricing looks like, talk to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/ppc-management\/\">Higher Visibility<\/a> about managing your PPC campaigns today to increase the success of your paid advertising.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"MOST_COMPANIES_STRUGGLE_WITH_GENERATING_POSITIVE_ROI_USING_GOOGLE_ADSWE_FIX_THAT-3\">MOST COMPANIES STRUGGLE WITH GENERATING POSITIVE ROI USING GOOGLE ADS...WE FIX THAT!<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many businesses grow strategically through PPC.
