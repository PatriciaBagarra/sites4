That means that 36.2 million Americans will be working remotely.\u00a0 This is a staggering 87% increase from the number of remote workers in America prior to the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p>These figures suggest remote working is here to stay for the American workforce, and without the commute and the need to stay in big cities traditionally known for their opportunities, here are the best places to live in the USA as a remote worker?<\/p>\n<p>To work this out, we took into consideration the number of green spaces, average broadband speed, amount of coffee shops, the average house rent and house prices as well as WiFi hotspots to discover which places in America are the best overall for remote work.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><u>Best Places to Remote Work in America with a Population of Under a Million<\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16772\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/underamillion.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"2300\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/underamillion.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/underamillion-326x500.jpg 326w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/underamillion-261x400.jpg 261w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/underamillion-768x1178.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/underamillion-1002x1536.jpg 1002w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/underamillion-1336x2048.jpg 1336w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>If you are looking for remote work in a town or city with a small population with all the needed factors for remote working, St Petersburg, Florida comes out at the top spot.<\/p>\n<p>The average house price is $284,709 which is just over $10,000 cheaper than the average house price across the States in 2020, and with almost 5,000 free WiFi spots you will never be far from an internet connection.<\/p>\n<p>Las Vegas comes in second. Surprisingly, Sin City, a destination for play not work is high on the list. Vegas may have a bigger population, however, this means access to more amenities with 269 coffee shops at hand for those remote workers who prefer to be close to a hot cup and a whopping 2,538 wifi-spots.<\/p>\n<p>From one party centre to another; Miami, Florida is third on the list. Even though house prices are almost $100,000 dollars above the US average, Miami has access to high-speed broadband at 1,000 Mbps as well as almost 4,000 wifi hotspots meaning you can enjoy working on the move across various sunny locations across the city.<\/p>\n<h2><strong><u>Best Places to Remote Work in America with a Population of Over a Million <\/u><\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>For those who are still wanting the energy of a big city, we collated the best places to live for remote work in cities with a population of over a million people.<\/p>\n<p>This also took into account the average cost of living and the Happiness Index.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-16773\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/overamillion.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"1500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/overamillion.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/overamillion-500x500.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/overamillion-400x400.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/overamillion-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/overamillion-120x120.jpg 120w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Texas cities dominate the top three spots, with the city of Houston out in front.
