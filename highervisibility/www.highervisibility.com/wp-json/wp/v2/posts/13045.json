With franchise marketing, there are two distinct factors that you have to take into account.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketing your business to get new franchisees<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Separately marketing those existing and new franchise locations in their local area<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>For instance, McDonald&#8217;s has to develop a plan to get franchisees to establish. But that\u2019s not all. They then have to produce marketing content for each new franchisee to attract customers to dine there.<\/p>\n<p>With franchise marketing, you will need a digital (and offline) strategy for both your corporate company and each franchise under your corporate umbrella.<\/p>\n<p>This means crafting different market strategies for various local areas where competition can vary dramatically as well as population sizes, actual business locations, etc.<\/p>\n<p>According to data from Wayne State University and professor Timothy Bates, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.entrepreneur.com\/article\/227394\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">out of 20,500 businesses studied, 65% of franchises survived after four years<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Compare that to independent businesses which see 72% survival rates after four years. In the retail space, it\u2019s even more grim for franchisees: 61.3% survival rates vs 73.1% for independently owned businesses.<\/p>\n<p>These survival rates signify a need for better, stable marketing plans that transcend beyond just the corporation and into each franchisee location. This is where things get tricky: how can you differentiate between corporate marketing and local franchise marketing?<\/p>\n<p>This is what we will show you in this guide. So, where do you start? By analyzing the local competition.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_do_Competitor_Research_Know_the_Competition\"><b>How to do Competitor Research (Know the Competition)<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Before jumping into a marketing game plan and hitting the ground running, you will need to do competitor research. And this goes for both your corporate plan and individual franchisee plans.<\/p>\n<p>Chances are, you&#8217;re not the only corporate entity in your space. Everything from fast food to plumbing to auto shops have competition. At the corporate level, you will need to assess who your top competitors are, what they are producing, and how they attract both customers and franchisee interest.<\/p>\n<p>At the franchisee level, you will need to assess competition in their local region and who you will be competing with for business.<\/p>\n<p>Thankfully, you can kill two birds with one stone here.<\/p>\n<p>In just a few easy steps, you can conduct basic competitor research for your corporate franchise \u00a0and franchisee locations.<\/p>\n<p>The key areas you want to assess here are:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who your direct competitors are<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where they have franchise locations in relation to your franchisees<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What marketing efforts they are using to promote the brand as a whole<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>First up, you will want to find your direct competitors. To do this, you can head to Google or even Google Maps and look for franchise companies near your corporate location or HQ.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, searching for other pest control companies in your area:<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13052\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/pest-control-serp.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"957\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/pest-control-serp.png 720w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/pest-control-serp-376x500.png 376w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/pest-control-serp-301x400.png 301w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As you will quickly notice, some household names pop up: Terminix, Orkin, etc.<\/p>\n<p>If you recognize business names, they could be franchise companies operating under the corporate brand name.<\/p>\n<p>These will be your competitors at both the corporate and franchisee level.<\/p>\n<p>Compile a list in a spreadsheet and save it for later.<\/p>\n<p>Next you will want to compare each of these competitors on your list to individual locations for your franchisees.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you have a franchisee located just outside of Nashville, examine if those same corporate competitors have locations here too. Chances are, you will uncover more data on competitors by doing so.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-13053\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/competitor-map-607x400.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"607\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/competitor-map-607x400.png 607w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/competitor-map-758x500.png 758w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/competitor-map-768x506.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/01\/competitor-map.png 1036w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 607px) 100vw, 607px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Adding them to the list, you should have a large list of potential competition. The last step is marketing research:<\/p>\n<p>What are your competitors doing to market their business? What social media platforms are they on? How often do they post on them? What content do they publish on social media? Are they using Google Ads? Do they have a blog where they write content?<\/p>\n<p>All of these questions will play a role in what you focus on in your marketing plan. For example, if your competitors aren\u2019t blogging, that\u2019s a huge opportunity for you. If they are dominating social media, you will have to put more stock into social to establish your own presence.<\/p>\n<p>Research the following factors and rank them from importance to decide where you will start to target:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Social media<\/b>: note how often they publish, how engaged their following is, and what type of content they post.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Blogging<\/b>: How often do they blog? What is the content about?<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Customer service<\/b>: What channels do they use for service? Compare those to your current service offerings.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Paid advertising<\/b>: Do they advertise on Google Ads? Conduct a search for their brand to see if they show for paid ads.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Local SEO<\/b>: <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigcommerce.com\/blog\/local-marketing\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">local marketing<\/a> is how well you are ranking for local searches in your niche. What local keywords or PPC campaigns are they running? How is their Google My Business Profile? What local events are they sponsoring?<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Offline marketing<\/b>: \u00a0What offline marketing tactics are they using? Direct mail? Booths? Fliers? Billboards? Radio? Conventions? Sponsoring local events?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>After you have compiled all of this data in a spreadsheet, you should have a clear picture of what the competition is doing. This serves a dual purpose:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It tells you what the baseline of your marketing has to be to remain competitive in the market.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It shows you areas that your competition isn\u2019t succeeding with, giving you direct chances to take market share in that area.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Now, let\u2019s identify a target audience before hitting the ground running!<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"Get_Your_Free_Franchise_Marketing_Plan_Template\">Get Your Free Franchise Marketing Plan Template<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Enter your email and instantly get a template to help you build out your franchise marketing plan.<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><div class=\"frm_forms  with_frm_style frm_style_hv-form-style\" id=\"frm_form_67_container\" >\n<form enctype=\"multipart\/form-data\" method=\"post\" class=\"frm-show-form  frm_pro_form  frm_ajax_submit \" id=\"form_b6plo\"  >\n<div class=\"frm_form_fields \">\n\n<div class=\"frm_fields_container\">\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"frm_action\" value=\"create\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"form_id\" value=\"67\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"frm_hide_fields_67\" id=\"frm_hide_fields_67\" value=\"\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"form_key\" value=\"b6plo\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item_meta[0]\" value=\"\" \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" id=\"frm_submit_entry_67\" name=\"frm_submit_entry_67\" value=\"8dd016a78c\" \/><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"_wp_http_referer\" value=\"\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/13045\" \/><input type=\"email\" id=\"field_crn8o\" name=\"item_meta[1370]\" value=\"\"  placeholder=\"Enter your email\" data-reqmsg=\"Please enter an email address.\" aria-required=\"true\" data-invmsg=\"Please enter a valid email address.\" aria-invalid=\"false\"  \/>\r\n\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item_meta[1374]\" id=\"field_homb3\" value=\"175.176.4.128\"  data-frmval=\"175.176.4.128\" data-invmsg=\"User IP is invalid\"   \/>\n<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item_meta[1375]\" id=\"field_8ih9a\" value=\"09\/08\/2021 02:29:39\"  data-frmval=\"09\/08\/2021 02:29:39\" data-invmsg=\"Time Stamp is invalid\"   \/>\n\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"item_key\" value=\"\" \/>\n\t<input name=\"frm_state\" type=\"hidden\" value=\"wTYNfagm1n2Z5xfePOlBfONjJ3n95gqxJ\/GE8pLbGjo=\" \/><button class=\"frm_button_submit frm_final_submit button primary\" type=\"submit\"   formnovalidate=\"formnovalidate\">Get Marketing Plan Template<\/button><\/div>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/form>\n<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"Identify_and_Locate_Your_Target_Audience\"><b>Identify and Locate Your Target Audience<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Identifying your target audience is key for multiple reasons. Without a clearly defined target audience, you will struggle to communicate value that resonates with your customer base.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, if you are a retail franchise selling clothes for millennial business workers but you are reaching CEO&#8217;s in their 50s and 60s, you won\u2019t be selling much product.<\/p>\n<p>Identifying your target audience and locating them is critical. If you place your business in the wrong location, it could be far out of the way and inconvenient for your target market.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, you wouldn\u2019t want to buy land in the suburbs if your business was catering to people living in populated city areas.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t currently have much of an online presence, you can craft a few distinct factors to identify and locate your ideal targets:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Demographics<\/b>: Age range, genders, etc.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Income<\/b>: average income \/ disposable income<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Pain points<\/b>: what your average customer has trouble with that you can fix or provide<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Online or offline<\/b>: where your target market is most receptive<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>General locations<\/b>: geographic locations where your target market is densely populated<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you already have an online presence, use tools like Facebook\u2019s audience insights to analyze your current audience for marketing campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>This data can be found on the Facebook Business Manager. Essentially, these insights will give you data on who engages with your Facebook business page the most, signifying their interests and other demographic data that can help you build a target

with a company. To meet these needs, you have to create an online presence that attracts, delights, and converts searchers into paying customers.<\/p>\n<p>Here are a few key marketing tactics to focus on when building your digital footprint.<\/p>\n<h4><span id=\"Website_Content_Development\"><b><br \/>\n<\/b><b>Website \/ Content Development <\/b><\/span><\/h4>\n<p>Building out your corporate website is a given. But just how do you do it?<\/p>\n<p>How do you create a website for your business that attracts qualified customers time and time again?<\/p>\n<p>There are two distinctive routes you can take with franchise marketing and websites:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Building out a single, corporate website with company information and a business location finder to help people locate a franchise near them<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Build out websites for each individual franchisee.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The most common setup is the first option, which we will discuss here. We highly recommend NOT building out new websites for each individual franchisee.<\/p>\n<p>Selecting the first choice, you can build up your corporate website with valuable content, videos, and information for customers (and those looking to franchise) without competing against yourself.<\/p>\n<p>Setting up websites for every franchisee can lead to competition issues for similar content ideas and keyword searches. I.e, duplicate content issues and competing against your own franchisees.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, both the franchisor and franchisee would be competing for articles about DIY bed bug treatments.<\/p>\n<p>This can lead to burdensome maintenance and even penalty issues with Google.<\/p>\n<p>So, where do you start?
