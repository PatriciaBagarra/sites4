It\u2019s also a great way to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/franchise-marketing\/\">market yourself<\/a> and gain site traffic. But when your business has multiple locations (like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/franchise-seo-services\/\">franchises<\/a>), the SEO strategy works a little differently.<\/p>\n<p>To get visibility and business from locals, you\u2019ll want to optimize what\u2019s called your local SEO. Local SEO is different from regular SEO because it takes into consideration your local area.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, when a customer searches for something that has local intent or identifies a specific location (say a city or county), search engines know they\u2019re looking for a local\u00a0business within a certain area or radius.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, approximately\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/seoexpertbrad.com\/local-seo-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">70% of customers visit a store<\/a>\u00a0based on information they find online, which means you need to make your locations search friendly so customers can visit them.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-13225 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/google-search-market-share.png\" alt=\"Google Search Market Share\" width=\"702\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/google-search-market-share.png 702w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/google-search-market-share-563x400.png 563w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n<p>In this article, I\u2019ll go over some tips to help you optimize your local SEO so all your locations get the visibility and attention they deserve from people searching locally.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Create_a_Separate_Landing_Page_for_Each_Location\">Create a Separate Landing Page for Each Location<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>While it\u2019s acceptable to have one domain for all locations, you\u2019ll still need to take a few steps to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/local-seo-company\/\">optimize local SEO<\/a> for each location so it can be found in local SERPS.<\/p>\n<p>Often, \u00a0business owners create just one master landing page for all their locations to share. While that may seem efficient (at least time wise), it doesn\u2019t do much in the way of optimizing your chances of popping up during local searches.<\/p>\n<p>The compromise to that is to have one website, but allocate a different page for each business location. Each of your pages should have information specific to that location. These include your business name, phone number, and address.<\/p>\n<p>And then you can take it a step further to add other customized content specific to that location, like testimonials; names, faces, and titles of staff; and any updates pertaining to that location.<\/p>\n<p>Also, it\u2019s helpful to have a Google map embedded on the location\u2019s page to show exactly where it sits in relevance to area streets and landmarks.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13207\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/local-seo-relevance-519x500.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"519\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/local-seo-relevance-519x500.png 519w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/local-seo-relevance-415x400.png 415w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/local-seo-relevance.png 550w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 519px) 100vw, 519px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@the_manifest\/8-local-seo-ranking-factors-e9f97e77e634\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>On the back-end of each page, make sure you create title tags and meta descriptions that are location specific. For instance, you might put \u201cSan Francisco Hair Salon\u201d in some form on both so the chances of you showing up in local queries is higher.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, you want to make sure each of these pages can be discovered by Google.<\/p>\n<p>Why Google?<\/p>\n<p>Because Google handles\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/statistics\/267161\/market-share-of-search-engines-in-the-united-states\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">approximately 60% of search queries,<\/a>\u00a0making it the most heavily used search engine out there.<\/p>\n<p>So how can you make sure it knows your site exists? By\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/183668?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">submitting your sitemap<\/a>. Simply put, a sitemap is a HTML or XML file that displays all the URLs your website has, the date you last updated each page, its metadata, etc.<\/p>\n<p>The XML sitemaps let search engines go through or crawl your website and jot notes on each of your pages so that it can then feed the information it\u2019s gathered into the right search results. It\u2019s basically a map of your website.<\/p>\n<p>HTML sitemaps, on the other hand, help users quickly find the content they\u2019re looking for when they visit your site. It\u2019s pretty much an outline version of your site.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Use_Google_My_Business_GMB\">Use Google My Business (GMB)<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Google My Business is a Google tool that helps you get on Google\u2019s apps and search results. Again, because this is the search engine that fields the most number of queries, we\u2019re focusing on it first.<\/p>\n<p>But it\u2019s also a good idea to look into how you display on other popular search engines like Bing and Yahoo and optimize your searchability on those as well.<\/p>\n<p>On Google platforms like Google search and Maps, your business profile will appear anytime your business shows up. \u00a0Google My Business lets you create an individual business listing\u00a0 for each location so each location page can show up uniquely during searches.<\/p>\n<p>Most importantly, make sure you follow the steps to verify each of your locations on Google My Business. To do this, you\u2019ll have to select the location you want to verify and click \u201cVerify now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>This will confirm the accuracy of your business information to Google and let you start showing up in queries.<\/p>\n<p>Next, add the hours for each location.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, make sure each of your locations displays the same information across the web. The name, address and phone number for each location should be the same in all listings where the location shows up.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, Gap shouldn\u2019t show up as Gap in one online directory but Gap Inc. in another. Also, make sure your hours of operations are listed accurately and the same every place your location appears on the web.<\/p>\n<p>Variations are a big deal to Google.<\/p>\n<p>If Google detects inconsistencies from different sources on the web, this will affect your success in the SEO department.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13208\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/main-qimg-d5e50d01df7e80c06e0fa0da75e0ce33-770x396.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"770\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/main-qimg-d5e50d01df7e80c06e0fa0da75e0ce33-770x396.jpg 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/main-qimg-d5e50d01df7e80c06e0fa0da75e0ce33-768x395.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/main-qimg-d5e50d01df7e80c06e0fa0da75e0ce33-779x400.jpg 779w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/main-qimg-d5e50d01df7e80c06e0fa0da75e0ce33.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/What-is-the-difference-between-an-eCommerce-SEO-and-a-local-SEO\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Finding out whether or not your locations display the same information across the board can be challenging. If you\u2019re not sure about your level of consistency across the web, you can use tools like Yext and Moz Local.<\/p>\n<p>These tools scour the internet for mentions of your business and make uniform all the information pertaining to it based on the details you provide. \u00a0They\u2019ll change Gap to Gap Inc. if the information you give them says Gap Inc. is correct. Or they\u2019ll correct your hours of operations based on what you say.<\/p>\n<p>The only drawback is you have to remain subscribed to these services for a lifetime if you want to continue seeing results. The moment you unsubscribe, they\u2019ll revert all your changes so information goes back to how it was originally displayed.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Manage_OnlineReviews_for_Each_Location\">Manage Online\u00a0Reviews for Each Location<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve got everything set up on Google, it\u2019s time to tackle another key step in the process: managing the reviews for each location (this should also be done on Yelp).<\/p>\n<p>Why is this important?<\/p>\n<p>Because when your location shows up in Google\u2019s results, your reviews will display immediately beneath your business name.<\/p>\n<p>But more importantly, potential\u00a0customers make decisions based on these reviews. For example, the average\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/seoexpertbrad.com\/local-seo-stats\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">customer will read approximately seven reviews<\/a>\u00a0before they form an opinion about any business or company.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why encouraging and showing appreciation for positive reviews and using strategic tactics to resolve negative ones will work in your favor. If people see you\u2019re active on reviews, they\u2019ll be more motivated to leave you one, which can help your rating soar higher.<\/p>\n<p>Bad reviews, on the other hand, can be tricky. If you receive one, which is pretty much inevitable, here are a few pointers to keep in mind:<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Dont_Lash_Out_at_the_Customer_or_Fight_Back\">Don\u2019t Lash Out at the Customer or Fight Back<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Reviews aren\u2019t the place to get ugly. No matter what the customer says, acknowledge their feelings and apologize for the experience. Even better, try to offer to make it up to them.<\/p>\n<p>Getting rude right back will only make you seem just as much at fault as them&#8211;except you have your business reputation to think of too.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13213\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/main-qimg-f70d6d60427be699939921d28a2619d5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"436\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/main-qimg-f70d6d60427be699939921d28a2619d5.png 680w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/main-qimg-f70d6d60427be699939921d28a2619d5-624x400.png 624w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.quora.com\/How-do-I-deal-with-negative-reviews-on-social-media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Be_Tactful_and_Positive\">Be Tactful and Positive<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Fight negativity with positivity. In other words, don\u2019t be negative right back to the client. Tell them you appreciated their visit, that you\u2019re sorry for anything less than an exceptional experience, that you would like a chance to make it up to them, or that you\u2019d like to collect more feedback offline.<\/p>\n<p>These are all positive statements to a negative situation, which can potentially help turn things around in your favor.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Mind_Your_Language_and_Tone\">Mind Your Language and Tone<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>People can pick up on verbal connotations even in writing. If you\u2019re being sarcastic or insincere, they\u2019ll be able to tell. Make sure you don\u2019t use inappropriate or condescending language. Most of all, make sure your message sounds sincere and accepting, not defensive or rude.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Focus_on_Localized_Link_Building\">Focus on Localized Link Building<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s easy for you to boast about your own site, but it means more when others do the boasting for you. This is possible when other sites link to your site.<\/p>\n<p>Backlinks are great because they boost your credibility on search engines and can help your local SEO. Ideally you want to build links from community specific websites or resources into your individual\u00a0location pages as this improves local signals and relevance.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13210\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/what-are-backlinks.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/what-are-backlinks.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/what-are-backlinks-711x400.png 711w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/what-are-backlinks-75x43.png 75w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.glimptech.com\/what-are-backlinks\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, there are several ways you can encourage people to backlink to you:<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Sponsor_an_Event\">Sponsor an Event<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>When you pour money or resources into a local event, like a college or school, you\u2019re doing a good thing for them and you. These institutions usually need extra funds. And when you sponsor them, they\u2019ll usually acknowledge you on their site through an honorable mention, often linking your website.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Host_Events\">Host Events<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Hosting local events is another way to encourage backlinks and boost your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/what-is-seo\/\">SEO<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Say for example you hold an event at your office for senior citizens, you can ask the right places to help promote that event by listing the name and location of it on their sites.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, you could approach and notify senior living communities, hospices, churches, etc. All of these places have an interest in promoting your event to their community. And in the process, mention of your site or business map on their site will result favorably toward your local SEO efforts.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Look_Into_Other_Neighborhood_Sponsorships\">Look Into Other Neighborhood Sponsorships<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Marathons and charities are everywhere. Engage with local events like these that are close to your business. You could sponsor these events or be a contributor in some way.<\/p>\n<p>Not only will you be giving to a worthy cause, but you\u2019ll also likely gain a mention on their website, which can positively impact your local rankings.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Track_the_Performance_for_Each_Location\">Track the Performance for Each Location<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Once you follow all of these steps to optimize local SEO for your locations, your work isn\u2019t over. Next, it\u2019s time to step back and see if all those efforts are paying off the way they should.<\/p>\n<p>Google My Business\u2019s Insights feature can be a tremendous tool for this. Essentially this is a dashboard that gives you information on your individual\u00a0pages and it\u2019s particularly useful when you\u2019re monitoring the site performance of several locations at once.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13215\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/screenshot-www.google.com-2019.03.22-10-47-11-770x272.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"770\" height=\"272\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/screenshot-www.google.com-2019.03.22-10-47-11-770x272.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/screenshot-www.google.com-2019.03.22-10-47-11-768x272.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/screenshot-www.google.com-2019.03.22-10-47-11-1130x400.png 1130w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/screenshot-www.google.com-2019.03.22-10-47-11.png 1136w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/business\/how-it-works\/insights\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>For instance, Insights will offer you a peek into things like the number of views your site had and information about searches that led target visitors to your site (like whether viewers found you on Google Search or Google Maps).<\/p>\n<p>It also displays what actions users took when they visited your site (did they call you directly from your landing page, request directions to your location, and visit your site multiple times?)<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13214\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/screenshot-www.google.com-2019.03.22-10-47-27-770x266.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"770\" height=\"266\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/screenshot-www.google.com-2019.03.22-10-47-27-770x266.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/screenshot-www.google.com-2019.03.22-10-47-27-768x265.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/screenshot-www.google.com-2019.03.22-10-47-27-1158x400.png 1158w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/screenshot-www.google.com-2019.03.22-10-47-27.png 1178w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/business\/how-it-works\/insights\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Insights also shows you one month\u2019s worth of queries so you can see which phrases and keywords people used to see your location pop up in their search results.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, Insights lets you track the site performance of all your locations so you can compare and see which pages are performing well and which ones aren\u2019t.<\/p>\n<p>Using these comparisons, you can figure out what one page has that another doesn\u2019t to help drive improvements.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Conclusion\">Conclusion<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>SEO is great to get your business site to show up in any kind of search results.
