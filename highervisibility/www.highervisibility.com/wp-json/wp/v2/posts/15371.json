That\u2019s why it\u2019s so important to determine what areas your potential SEO expert specializes in.<\/p>\n<p>The most common types of SEO are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Technical SEO<\/li>\n<li>On-Page SEO<\/li>\n<li>Off-Page SEO<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/local-seo-company\/\">Local SEO<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Mobile SEO<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Most SEO Experts will have expertise in the three most important types of SEO that websites need to be optimized for.<\/p>\n<p>They are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Technical SEO<\/li>\n<li>On-Page SEO<\/li>\n<li>Off-Page SEO<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Ideally, a website will have all three of these areas optimized. If one is lacking, the website isn&#8217;t going to rank as high as it could.<\/p>\n<p>For example, a website might be technically sound, but if the on-page SEO is poor then the webpages aren\u2019t going to rank well.<\/p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a further look at these different SEO types to get a better understanding of what\u2019s involved in each.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Technical_SEO\">Technical SEO<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>We define technical SEO as the process of improving the technical aspects of a website to increase the ranking of its pages in search engines.<\/p>\n<p>Technical SEO involves making optimizations to a site that makes it more efficient to crawl and index. This allows Google to deliver the right content from your site to users at the right time.<\/p>\n<p>A website owner can have the best website with the best content, but their website isn&#8217;t going to rank if their technical SEO has been neglected.<\/p>\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot to technical SEO, and while this isn\u2019t a definitive list, an SEO expert proficient in technical SEO should be able to do the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Identify any crawl errors on a website.<\/li>\n<li>Find out how Google views a website&#8217;s pages.<\/li>\n<li>Ensure a website is mobile-friendly.<\/li>\n<li>Make sure a website is secured correctly.<\/li>\n<li>Check a website&#8217;s loading speed.<\/li>\n<li>Fix any broken links.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span id=\"On-Page_SEO\">On-Page SEO<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>On-Page SEO refers to the optimization of web pages in order to rank higher. With a higher rank, they can earn more relevant organic traffic from <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/seo-spiders\/\">search engines<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>In other words, On-Page SEO involves optimizing all of the elements that affect SEO <strong>on <\/strong>a website.<\/p>\n<p>An ideally optimized webpage should do the following:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be relevant to a specific topic or keyword (discovered through keyword research).<\/li>\n<li>The subject or keyword of the page should be included in the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/the-dos-and-donts-of-writing-title-tags-for-seo\/\">title tag<\/a>, URL, and image alt text.<\/li>\n<li>The subject or keyword should be specified several times throughout the text content on the page.<\/li>\n<li>A web page should link back to its sub-category or category page, if applicable.<\/li>\n<li>Link back to the homepage (usually achieved with an image link showing the website logo on the top left of a page).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>You can use the checklist above as a reference point if you\u2019re discussing On-Page <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/10-skills-every-seo-expert-should-have\/\">SEO with an expert<\/a>, or ask what On-Page SEO practices they recommend.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Off-Page_SEO\">Off-Page SEO<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Off-Page SEO refers to all actions taken outside a website that impact search rankings.<\/p>\n<p>Rather than a set of SEO principles, off-page SEO refers to SEO tactics that improve a web pages search rankings such as:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/link-building\/\">Link building<\/a>.<\/li>\n<li>Brand building.<\/li>\n<li>Citation building.<\/li>\n<li>Social media marketing.<\/li>\n<li>Content marketing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>An easy way to think of Off-Page SEO is any tactic used to improve SEO that doesn\u2019t involve making changes to a website itself or publishing content to a website.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you write a great blog post and it gets retweeted by an influencer in your niche, this would count as an example of Off-Page SEO.<\/p>\n<p>As there are quite a few different off-page SEO tactics available, you should check with any SEO expert that you&#8217;re interviewing or hiring to see which Off-Page SEO tactics they specialize in or what they recommend for your particular situation.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15373\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/seo-tactics.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"175\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/blog\/off-page-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"WHY_NOT_WORK_WITH_THE_2020_SEO_AGENCY_OF_THE_YEAR-2\">WHY NOT WORK WITH THE 2020 SEO AGENCY OF THE YEAR?<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped hundreds of businesses generate more online leads and sales through SEO.

Know Some SEO Basics and Define Your Objectives<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>While it may seem counterintuitive, it\u2019s not a bad idea to learn\/know some SEO basics yourself before hiring an expert.<\/p>\n<p>Knowing the basics will help you define what you want an SEO campaign to look like and what you want to achieve.<\/p>\n<p>For example, just having a goal of getting \u2018more traffic\u2019 is a little bit broad. Instead, try and define how much new traffic you want to be brought in during a specific time frame, e.g., \u2018I want to increase my web traffic by 15% over the next 12 months.\u2019<\/p>\n<p>The more specific your goals and objectives can be, the better. By defining your goals and objectives, the SEO expert you\u2019re working with will be able to give you a much clearer understanding of whether your objectives are realistic and if they can be hit.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"2_Tap_into_Your_Professional_Network_for_Recommendations\">2. Tap into Your Professional Network for Recommendations.<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>The easiest way to find a trusted SEO Expert is to ask your professional network.<\/p>\n<p>Ask yourself: do you know anyone who works in SEO? Do you know anyone in your network who\u2019s used an SEO expert that they could refer to you? Can you post on LinkedIn asking your network to recommend an SEO expert?<\/p>\n<p>A referral from a fellow professional is always appreciated, and if you trust the person, you can be confident that their referral will produce good work.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"3_Check_Review_Sites\">3. Check Review Sites<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Sites like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bestseocompanies.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BestSEOCompanies.com<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/clutch.co\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Clutch<\/a> can give you detailed lists of the best SEO Agencies and Professionals in your area.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-15376 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/screenshot-www.bestseocompanies.com-2021.03.10-11_29_51-534x400.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"534\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/screenshot-www.bestseocompanies.com-2021.03.10-11_29_51-534x400.png 534w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/screenshot-www.bestseocompanies.com-2021.03.10-11_29_51-667x500.png 667w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/screenshot-www.bestseocompanies.com-2021.03.10-11_29_51-768x575.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/screenshot-www.bestseocompanies.com-2021.03.10-11_29_51-1536x1151.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/screenshot-www.bestseocompanies.com-2021.03.10-11_29_51.png 1718w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bestseocompanies.com\/top-50-seo-company-rankings\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>A quick way to do this is to simply type \u2018top SEO services (area) clutch\u2019 into Google, click the first link, and you\u2019ll be greeted by a list of the top-rated SEO companies in your area. You can review the top results in the list to narrow down the options for SEO experts or companies you\u2019re looking to hire.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"4_Check_for_Testimonials_and_Case_Studies\">4. Check for Testimonials and Case Studies<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>You may find that checking out reviews for a company or SEO expert are sufficient, but for a more in-depth look at their services and processes, you may want to check for testimonials and case studies.<\/p>\n<p>For example, when you click onto the HigherVisibility website and navigate to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO services <\/a>page, you can read an in-depth case study of how we helped Caliber Collision generate a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/case-study\/caliber-collision-seo\/\">141.41%<\/a> increase in organic conversions in 12 months.<\/p>\n<p><strong> <img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15372\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/calibeer-case-study.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"392\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>By reading prior case studies, you can get invaluable insights into how the company or individual you&#8217;re looking to hire operates and the results they can bring to your business.<\/p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t find case studies or testimonials on a candidate\u2019s website, don\u2019t be afraid to ask for them. If they refuse to give you any, then it\u2019s ok to be afraid.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"What_Questions_Should_You_Ask_an_SEO_Expert_Before_Hiring_Them\">What Questions Should You Ask an SEO Expert Before Hiring Them?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>After you\u2019ve shortlisted the potential SEO experts or companies you want to work with, you can begin the interview process.<\/p>\n<p>Just like any interview, it\u2019s a good idea to have a set of questions prepared that you can ask your candidates.<\/p>\n<p>The aim of these questions should be to get a better understanding of the services the company\/individual is providing, to see whether they\u2019re going to be able to get the results you desire, and discover which shortlisted expert is the best fit for your business.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some examples of questions to ask.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Do_You_Have_Experience_in_My_Industry_or_With_My_Type_of_WebsiteBusiness\">Do You Have Experience in My Industry or With My Type of Website\/Business?<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>SEO isn\u2019t a one size fits all undertaking, and the length of time it takes to see meaningful results can differ from site to site.<\/p>\n<p>For example, suppose you run a pizzeria in Denver. In that case, you\u2019ll want to show up in map listings your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/how-search-queries-work-on-google-webmaster-tools\/\">search queries<\/a> (e.g., Pizzerias in Denver). If this is the case, you may want to hire an SEO expert or agency that has expertise in local SEO.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re running an online service-based business where you don\u2019t have a physical location, your SEO requirements are going to be different than those of a local restaurant owner.<\/p>\n<p>Spend some time asking any prospective SEO expert you\u2019re thinking of working with about their prior experience with your industry\/business.
