Unlike dedicated store platforms like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.shopify.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shopify<\/a> or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/bigcommerce-seo-best-practices\/\">BigCommerce<\/a>, WooCommerce acts as an addition to your website.<\/p>\n<p>That means that it is going to tie overall performance to how good of a job you\u2019ve done building your WordPress website. That can be a little more tricky.<\/p>\n<p>But it also means there\u2019s much more flexibility, which is probably why they\u2019ve been downloaded <a href=\"https:\/\/trends.builtwith.com\/shop\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">more than 50 million times<\/a>. They also boast a diverse client base, selling everything from mattresses to cupcakes.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12879\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/woocommerce-clients.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"912\" height=\"206\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/woocommerce-clients.png 912w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/woocommerce-clients-770x174.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/woocommerce-clients-768x173.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/woocommerce.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>They claim to have built the platform itself with best practices in mind.<\/p>\n<p>And with a broad variety of extensions, WooCommerce is a good platform to integrate with inventory management, sales tracking, and even <a href=\"https:\/\/woocommerce.com\/product-category\/woocommerce-extensions\/payment-gateways\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">payment processors<\/a>.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-12880\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/payments-444x400.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"444\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/payments-444x400.png 444w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/payments-554x500.png 554w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/payments.png 723w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 444px) 100vw, 444px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/woocommerce.com\/product-category\/woocommerce-extensions\/payment-gateways\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>So if you have a pre-existing brick-and-mortar operation, you don\u2019t have to change everything up to add on a mobile site. That\u2019s a huge plus for many brands.<\/p>\n<p>Here\u2019s a good video overview of everything that you can do with the WooCommerce platform:<\/p>\n<div align=\"center\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/1KahlicghaE?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><span data-mce-type=\"bookmark\" style=\"display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;\" class=\"mce_SELRES_start\">\ufeff<\/span><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>So to sum everything up, WooCommerce is easy to install, flexible, and free. You\u2019ll only need to pay for extensions and other tools that allow you extra capabilities when growing your online store.<\/p>\n<p>But now for the tough question &#8211; can WooCommerce get you to the top of the search results on Google or Bing?<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Is_WooCommerce_a_Good_Ecommerce_Platform_for_SEO\"><b>Is WooCommerce a Good Ecommerce Platform for SEO?<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>The short answer to this question is \u201cyes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The longer answer is that the WooCommerce platform is custom-built for SEO, but it\u2019s only as good as your overall <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/ecommerce-seo\/\">e-commerce SEO strategy<\/a>. The coding WooCommerce uses is a great start, but you still need to do quite a bit of legwork to be at the top of the different search engines.<\/p>\n<p>And from a big-picture view, going with WooCommerce for SEO is a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, it makes up a staggering <a href=\"https:\/\/kinsta.com\/wordpress-market-share\/#woocommerce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">35% of the <i>entire Internet<\/i><\/a><i>.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12881\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/woocommerce-usage.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"918\" height=\"327\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/woocommerce-usage.png 918w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/woocommerce-usage-770x274.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/woocommerce-usage-768x274.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 918px) 100vw, 918px\" \/> <\/i><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/kinsta.com\/wordpress-market-share\/#woocommerce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>So if any platform is going to be simultaneously good and bad for your SEO, it\u2019s WooCommerce. It\u2019s very good at what it does, especially for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/ecommerce-seo-services\/\">Ecommerce SEO<\/a>. Hence, everyone uses it.<\/p>\n<p>And since everyone uses it, the competition is that much higher. Shopify boasts fewer sites but more in the top 10,000.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t let that dissuade you from using WooCommerce though.<\/p>\n<p>They\u2019re still arguably one of the best, most customizable online store builders on the web, and they could very well be your best option.<\/p>\n<p>So if you do decide to use them, you\u2019ll want to keep these five tips in mind as you build and refine your website.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Tip_1_Install_the_Yoast_SEO_Plugin\"><b>Tip #1: Install the Yoast SEO Plugin<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Since you\u2019re using WordPress to build your site, you have the distinct advantage of getting to use powerful plugins to add functionality to your site.<\/p>\n<p>One of the best of these is the <a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/yoast-woocommerce-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast WooCommerce SEO plugin<\/a>, which consequently is one of the top 10 most downloaded WordPress plugins.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12882\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/yoast.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1068\" height=\"257\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/yoast.png 1068w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/yoast-770x185.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/yoast-768x185.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1068px) 100vw, 1068px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/yoast-woocommerce-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>For good reason, too.<\/p>\n<p>Out of the box, WooCommerce has a solid SEO structure, but there\u2019s still plenty of work you can do.

After all, how different do the descriptions for similar products that you own really need to be?<\/p>\n<p>That type of thinking leads to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/how-to-fix-the-most-common-technical-seo-issues-on-wordpress\/\">duplicate content<\/a>, which can very easily hurt your SEO.<\/p>\n<p>When you have duplicate content on your site, <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/duplicate-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google has to decide<\/a> which is the original.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-12884\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/descriptions-617x400.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"617\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/descriptions-617x400.png 617w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/descriptions-770x500.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/descriptions-768x498.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/descriptions.png 780w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 617px) 100vw, 617px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/duplicate-content\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>And when it decides on an original, that\u2019s the only one that\u2019s going to have a shot at being ranked. If the products are different, that\u2019s a huge problem.<\/p>\n<p>Your best line of defense against this is to ensure that you have unique, engaging copy on all of your product pages. This lets Google see that you\u2019ve got a broader variety of unique products, and increases the chances that you\u2019ll get a better ranking.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Tip_4_Use_a_Clean_Site_Structure_and_Logical_URLs\"><b>Tip #4: Use a Clean Site Structure and Logical URLs<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Since you build WooCommerce off your WordPress website, you\u2019ll have more control over every aspect of how you develop and execute your final product. That can be a double-edged sword though.<\/p>\n<p>When you build a site, especially for ecommerce, you need to think about the <a href=\"https:\/\/canonicalized.com\/woocommerce-seo-optimization\/?section=site-structure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">overall site structure<\/a>.

The same structure <a href=\"https:\/\/getcodeless.com\/content-strategy-framework\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">applies to any content<\/a> that you create also.<\/p>\n<p>And a big part of that is using a URL structure that mirrors your site\u2019s overall navigation scheme as well.

That means you can add details like reviews and images that help entice viewers to click.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12877\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/rich-snippets.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"503\" height=\"127\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The backend of this can get very technical, too, so your best bet to keep it simple is to use a plugin like <a href=\"https:\/\/wordpress.org\/plugins\/all-in-one-schemaorg-rich-snippets\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">All In One Schema Rich Snippets<\/a>. This will let you create rich snippets, track them to see what\u2019s working, and then edit as necessary.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that you may not see rich snippets for quite some time after you create them. According to Google, it could take \u201ca month or so.\u201d<\/p>\n<div align=\"center\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/thS5ryMXN88?rel=0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>But SEO is a long-term effort, so you should still take the time to use rich snippets for your WooCommerce product pages.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Tip_6_Optimize_for_Site_Speed\"><b>Tip #6: Optimize for Site Speed<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A recent study showed that a one-second delay on your site will <a href=\"https:\/\/conversionxl.com\/blog\/11-low-hanging-fruits-for-increasing-website-speed-and-conversions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">net 7% fewer conversions<\/a> on your website.

They signal to Google what you value internally on your site, which can help them weigh and rank your most important pages accordingly.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hobo-web.co.uk\/optimize-website-navigation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Mueller from Google<\/a> put it this way:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo position on a page for internal links is pretty much irrelevant from our point of view. \u00a0We crawl, we use these mostly for crawling within a website, <b>for understanding the context of individual pages within a website<\/b>.<\/p>\n<p>And by emphasizing the right pages, you can dictate to Google with products and pages need to stand out.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-12885\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/heirarchy-492x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"492\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/heirarchy-492x400.jpg 492w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/heirarchy.jpg 506w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 492px) 100vw, 492px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.hobo-web.co.uk\/optimize-website-navigation\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Using this method, you have a little more say in your overall SEO strategy and can impact Google\u2019s interpretation on your site. Otherwise, Google just has to guess, which isn\u2019t as good for you.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Tip_8_Focus_on_Quality_Product_Imagery\"><b>Tip #8: Focus on Quality Product Imagery<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When someone comes to your site or sees your product on a search engine, one of the first elements that they\u2019ll notice is the image you use.<\/p>\n<p>If that image is grainy, poorly shot, or not representative of the final product, there\u2019s a good chance that will <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bngdesign.net\/why-poor-quality-images-on-your-e-commerce-website-push-away-buyers-and-hurt-your-business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">drive visitors away<\/a> from your site. Like it or not, visuals are essential for building traffic.<\/p>\n<p>So when creating images to put on your site, keep <a href=\"https:\/\/productsup.io\/blog\/tips-high-quality-product-images\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">some of these tips<\/a> in mind:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use high-resolution images.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get a variety of angles, even if it means multiple images.<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Use lighting to be as accurate as possible (for color, shadows, etc.)<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>And if you\u2019re not a practiced photographer, or if you lack the equipment, hiring someone to take product photos can be a great investment. You\u2019ll lose more from bad images than you pay to get good ones.<\/p>\n<p>One final consideration with images is to ensure that the size doesn\u2019t negatively impact your SEO. Depending on what type of file you use when you add an image, it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wpbeginner.com\/wordpress-performance-speed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">could drastically impact <\/a>how large the final page ends up.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12876\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/10\/image-optimization.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"520\" height=\"342\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.wpbeginner.com\/wordpress-performance-speed\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Whenever possible, use the smallest file size available. When you couple a small-sized image with a high-quality photo, your SEO will be much better off.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Conclusion\"><b>Conclusion<\/b><\/span><\/h2>\n<p>WooCommerce makes up more than one-third of the Internet, so you know it can be a great way to build your online store.<\/p>\n<p>With plenty of plugin options, tons of flexibility, and an excellent SEO potential, it\u2019s hard to see where you could go wrong with WooCommerce.<\/p>\n<p>Start by installing the Yoast SEO plugin for WooCommerce. This will act as your first line of defense for SEO and can fill in the gaps as you learn what works best for your site.<\/p>\n<p>You should also take the time to optimize your headlines and create unique product descriptions that Google and its users will want to read.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also a good idea to ensure that your site has a logical structure that allows users to flow through and convert as easily as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Be sure to utilize rich snippets that entice visitors to click on your product pages and see what you have to offer. When paired with increased site speeds, you can see more traffic and better sales over time.<\/p>\n<p>Adding internal links is also a great way to boost your WooCommerce SEO, as this gives crawlers a better idea of what you think is important.<\/p>\n<p>And finally, make sure that you use quality images with small file sizes. This will help users see your products and not leave from slow load times.<\/p>\n<p>With all of these tips and tools in place, you\u2019ll be better situated to win traffic and convert them into customers in the long-term. Your SEO will be off to a great start, which is exactly why WooCommerce is such an appealing platform.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Contents1 Why Use WooCommerce?2 Is
