It doesn\u2019t mean for writers to just create an article or blog post that is cluttered and has tons of keyword stuffing in it.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It means to create quality content that is so helpful and valuable that Google has no option other than to include it because it enriches the search results.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_to_Develop_Your_Content_Strategy\"><strong>How to Develop Your Content Strategy?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be able to write content that is more effective in Google, you must start by performing the necessary research. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can\u2019t expect to just write different types of content and have it rank. There is pre-planning involved to be able to ensure what you compose actually warrants Google to rank you.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To be able to pre-plan, start creating an outline by answering the following questions: <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"1_Whos_Your_Audience\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">1.

What Are You Writing About?<\/span><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you know who you are writing for\u2026you need to know what you\u2019re going to write about.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The foundation of any successful SEO content is keyword research. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The purpose of this guide is not to teach you how to perform keyword research, that can be found on this helpful guide from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/ahrefs.com\/blog\/keyword-research\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ahrefs\u2019<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (Why reinvent the wheel).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Keyword research can provide you with insight into how topics are searched for, what their wants &amp; needs are, and ultimately you\u2019ll understand your audience better.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"3_What_Questions_Must_Be_Answered\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">3. What Questions Must Be Answered?<\/span><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So you have a primary keyword that you want to cover. The next phase of your pre-planning research should be focused around understanding user intent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To understand user intent you need to know if your topic is Informational or Transactional? <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Informational means that the keyword is broader and that the user typing that into Google is searching for more information to help guide them (hence the name).<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An example of this would be: \u201cHow to Ride a Bicycle\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12662 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Informational.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"864\" height=\"1238\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Informational.png 864w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Informational-349x500.png 349w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Informational-768x1100.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Informational-279x400.png 279w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 864px) 100vw, 864px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notice that the results for this term are primarily videos and articles explaining the process of learning to ride a bicycle. There are no listings of websites that try to sell anything because Google understands the user intent is trying to get an answer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Transactional means that the topic indicates there is an intent to make a purchase or complete a purchase or transaction.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">An example of this would be: \u201cMongoose Bicycle\u201d.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12670 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Transactional.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1073\" height=\"1132\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Transactional.png 1073w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Transactional-474x500.png 474w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Transactional-768x810.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Transactional-379x400.png 379w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1073px) 100vw, 1073px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notice how sponsored shopping ads are being displayed, followed by organic results of websites that sell Mongoose bicycles. Google understands based on the history that users that type this query in, people are typically looking to make a purchase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that we know what Informational &amp; Transactional mean, why is this <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/why-is-seo-important\/\">important for SEO<\/a>?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To effectively write content that can perform well in the SERPS it is imperative to know user intent. This is essentially Google telling you the type of content that must be written to have a chance at success. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using the example above for \u201cmongoose bicycle\u201d. By taking a look at the organic listings I can immediately tell this is transactional so I will want to make sure the copy I create is written to focus on a consumer who is looking to make a purchase instead of simply writing about the history of the mongoose bicycle.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are other clues that you can take from the organic listings as well that help in answering users questions:<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12668 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/serp-questions.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"729\" height=\"667\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/serp-questions.png 729w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/serp-questions-546x500.png 546w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/serp-questions-437x400.png 437w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 729px) 100vw, 729px\" \/><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Notice how Google displays types of bikes, prices, reviews, &amp; parts. Knowing that Google is connecting those terms with the main topic, I want to make sure in my writing, I talk about those descriptors.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"4_How_Comprehensive_Is_My_Topic\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">4. How Comprehensive Is My Topic?<\/span><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As mentioned above, when creating content you want to make it so helpful that Google has no option but to rank you because you have covered this topic better than anyone else. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Based on this you need to know how comprehensive a particular topic is. One of the best ways of researching this is to analyze the Page 1 organic listings and identify the length of their text. I then average out the length of that copy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do find this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While there are several tools that do this, my favorite is <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\/seo-content-template\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEMRush\u2019s SEO Content Template<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After inputting a primary topic or keyword, SEMRush does most of the work for you. They scan the top 10 ranking sites and spit out the average text length. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12669 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/text-length.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1020\" height=\"934\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/text-length.png 1020w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/text-length-546x500.png 546w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/text-length-768x703.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/text-length-437x400.png 437w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px\" \/><br \/>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this is not a hard and fast metric, it should be used as a directional metric. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is helpful because if the Top 10 ranking sites average text length is 3000 words and I write a piece of content that is 400 words, there is a good chance Google won\u2019t view my coverage of the topic as comprehensive enough.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This can sometimes be construed the opposite though as well. It also doesn\u2019t mean that by writing 10,000 words you will be viewed as the best. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Make sure you try to answer the user intent and do so as thoroughly as possible.<\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"5_Whats_Your_Unique_Value\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">5. What\u2019s Your Unique Value?<\/span><\/span><\/h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The last step in developing your content strategy for individual page optimization is identifying your unique value.<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">What have the top sites failed to cover? <\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Where have they covered but not extensively enough?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Could the reader benefit from seeing visuals within the copy to better understand?<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have a special understanding of a topic better than most where you can give more insight than a layman?<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many scenarios where one could cover the same topic as many others but tie in their unique value. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Unfortunately, there are no magic tools that do this for you. One must analyze by manually reviewing the competing pages to find those opportunities or gaps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But finding your unique value is the difference between everyone else and the best in class.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"How_do_you_make_content_SEO_Friendly\"><strong>How do you make content SEO Friendly?<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you have researched and developed the pre-planning strategy of your content, now comes the actual writing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are 6 steps you will want to follow to make sure your content is written with search engine optimization in mind:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 1: Create a catchy Title (Headline) that incorporates your primary keyword<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not all Titles are created equal. Outside of the content itself, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/12-ways-to-create-test-and-optimize-successful-headlines\/\">quality headline<\/a> is arguably the biggest difference between successful engagement and a flopper.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is the first thing that a user will see when performing a search. In fact, on average 5 Times as many people read the headline as the body copy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Best practice is to try to incorporate your primary keyword towards the front of your Title if at all possible. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Title should be no longer than 600 Pixels in length. (if you use WordPress and have <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/yoast.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yoast<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> installed they tell you this when creating the page. If you don\u2019t have WordPress, I\u2019d recommend using the <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/title-tag\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moz Title Tag Preview Tool<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.)<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-12663 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/moz-title.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"892\" height=\"257\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/moz-title.png 892w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/moz-title-770x222.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/moz-title-768x221.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 892px) 100vw, 892px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It takes time to write an engaging headline.

Search engines typically show the meta description as a snippet of text in the results pages.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12661\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/description.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"567\" height=\"131\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While not a direct search engine ranking factor, meta descriptions are vital to gaining high click-through-rates from the SERPs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is a best practice to try to incorporate your primary keyword(s) within the description in a natural, non-spammy way. Always ask yourself, is this how a person would talk? If no, you might want to consider writing it more instinctive way.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While Google can truncate your snippet, it is also recommended to try and stay below 300 characters.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One way to test or preview a meta description is using our handy <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/seo\/tools\/serp-snippet-optimizer\/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SERP Optimization Too<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">l:<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-16906 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Google-SERP-Snip-1.png\" alt=\"Google SERP Snippet\" width=\"903\" height=\"709\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Google-SERP-Snip-1.png 903w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Google-SERP-Snip-1-637x500.png 637w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Google-SERP-Snip-1-509x400.png 509w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/Google-SERP-Snip-1-768x603.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 903px) 100vw, 903px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You simply enter in your description idea and see how it fits character wise and also looks in the preview.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 3: Write the Content using your pre-planned outline<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This step is pretty self-explanatory. This is where you actually write the content using all of the elements you previously gathered in your analysis.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I find it helpful to just write and once I feel like I have covered the topic completely, then go back and edit where necessary. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don\u2019t want to feel too boxed in and have it alter your creative freedom.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 4: Make sure your Content answers your audience&#8217;s questions<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Briefly discussed in the content strategy above, you want to make sure your content answers the common questions your audience might have.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Incorporating this ensures your copy is comprehensive in nature.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So, how do you find this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are many tools to help, but I\u2019m going to give you the few that I use based on personal preference:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google &#8211; The first thing I do is type in my primary keyword(s).

If you enter a keyword and click on \u201cquestions\u201d, they will provide you a list of the search queries that include the primary term you entered.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12658\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/ahrefs-questions.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"645\" height=\"378\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/ahrefs-questions.png 645w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/ahrefs-questions-75x43.png 75w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 645px) 100vw, 645px\" \/><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once I have the common questions, I look to ensure my content has answers to the most common questions related to my topic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 5: Incorporate semantic keywords to enrich your text<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to \u201csearch\u201d, semantic essentially means related. As it relates to the contextual meaning of a word.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">From an SEO perspective, having semantically related terms to your \u201cprimary keyword(s)\u201d helps provide a more connected and complete understanding of your topic.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So how do you do this?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By now the content should be written. This is important because to get the most accurate data back, you want to analyze the copy you just wrote against the copy of the top ranking websites for your primary keyword(s).<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are several great tools you can use to do this, but I tend to use <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/en.ryte.com\/product\/content-success\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ryte\u2019s Content Success<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> tool. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-12666\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/ryte.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"971\" height=\"467\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/ryte.png 971w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/ryte-770x370.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/ryte-768x369.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/07\/ryte-832x400.png 832w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 971px) 100vw, 971px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you click on \u201coptimize your content\u201d you can literally enter in all the copy you wrote and specify your primary keyword and Ryte will do the analysis for you based off researching the top ranking sites.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It will tell you what keywords to incorporate more within your text, which ones to reduce, and which ones to remove altogether.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you update your copy you can continuously re-check for completeness. While this doesn\u2019t guarantee you will rank, it helps ensure your content is topically in-line with your competitors.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>Step 6: Review the final content to ensure its readability<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The final step is to look at your content from a subjective point of view. If you were to come across this content, how easy would it be to read?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Have you checked for:<\/span><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Grammatical errors<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Spelling errors<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sentence structure<\/span><\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Etc.<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The question you must ask yourself is, is your content fitting for your target audience?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Conclusion\"><strong>Conclusion<\/strong><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Writing effective SEO content takes thorough analysis &amp; \u00a0planning. But when done properly, the results speak for themselves. Take the extra time to do it right because releasing low-quality or thin content that doesn\u2019t provide value only hurts your site in the long run.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Happy writing!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Contents1 What is SEO Writing?2 How to Develop Your Content Strategy?2.1 1.
