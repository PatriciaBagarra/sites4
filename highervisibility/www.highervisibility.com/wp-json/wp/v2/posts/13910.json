You got into it to defend the innocent or ensure the guilty received their due.<\/p>\n<p>And yet, here you are \u2014 wondering how you can succeed in the hyper-competitive legal industry.<\/p>\n<p>But with so many law firm marketing strategies to choose between, it can be a headache to know where to start.<\/p>\n<p>And without the right knowledge of how to access your target clients effectively, many law firms waste time, money, and resources.<\/p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll cover the leading digital marketing strategies your law firm needs to know to succeed in 2020.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Law_Firm_Marketing_Strategy_1_Create_a_Clear_Brand_Narrative\">Law Firm Marketing Strategy #1: Create a Clear Brand Narrative<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>A successful strategic narrative tells the story behind your existence as a company, defining what makes you unique in a human way.<\/p>\n<p>Your narrative should be reflected in your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/5-ways-to-evaluate-your-website-content-vs-a-competitors-content\/\">website content<\/a>, content marketing, visual branding, social media presence, and so on. This continuity conveys your law firm\u2019s values, ethics, and company mission at all times.<\/p>\n<p>This story-line should communicate how your law firm believes that value is created, along with how you intend to bring that value to the table.<\/p>\n<p>A strong strategic narrative should humanize your company to your potential client base. Studies have shown that people tend to see legal companies as people rather than objects, leaning toward services that foster the human context.<\/p>\n<p>It has been shown that a company\u2019s \u2018warmth and competence\u2019 tend to be <a href=\"https:\/\/thehumanbrand.com\/assets\/uploads\/second\/The_HUMAN_Brand_Book_Intro.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">twice as persuasive<\/a> as the benefits of the services offered. In this respect, a confluent story-line serves to entice customers who feel aligned with these values.<\/p>\n<p>In this sense, when crafting a strategic brand narrative, you should communicate your unique sales points as having a shared purpose with your target audience. By doing this effectively, you show your customers how you endeavor to meet that purpose.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Take Starbucks\u2019 mission statement, for example. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A summarized version of the coffee company\u2019s narrative, the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.starbucks.com\/about-us\/company-information\/mission-statement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">mission<\/a> aims <em>\u2018to inspire and nurture the human spirit \u2014 one person, one cup and one neighborhood at a time.\u2019 <\/em>Here, Starbucks defines itself as focusing on community values and enriching the human spirit, while inspiring and nurturing customers.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13912\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/starbucks-mission.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"488\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/starbucks-mission.png 800w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/starbucks-mission-770x470.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/starbucks-mission-656x400.png 656w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/starbucks-mission-768x468.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=i&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.luckscout.com%2Fstarbucks-mission-statement%2F&amp;psig=AOvVaw0KZWH5Mdzh49Qenn_0t13t&amp;ust=1585758637967000&amp;source=images&amp;cd=vfe&amp;ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCLDVrbaRxegCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">(Image Source)<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>With this statement, Starbucks is targeting a specific subset of hot beverage drinkers.

Without well-defined metrics, your firm will have no idea which marketing campaigns work well and which are a waste of resources.<\/p>\n<p><strong>When creating a legal marketing strategy, defining your goals is paramount. <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>By creating a vision of what your law firm&#8217;s aims are, you can reverse engineer the steps needed to achieve these end goals. This allows your law firm to more effectively allocate time, money, and resources to achieve these marketing goals.<\/p>\n<p>The goals set out in your marketing strategy will define how you approach marketing campaigns, the marketing strategies you deploy, and the channels used to reach your audience.<\/p>\n<p>For example, LinkedIn is likely to be the most useful channel for identifying new partners for your firm. On the other hand, pay-per-click (PPC) ads on insurance websites are likely to have a higher chance of successfully drawing in personal injury claimants.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13913\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/social-channel-marketing.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1244\" height=\"396\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/social-channel-marketing.png 1244w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/social-channel-marketing-770x245.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/social-channel-marketing-1170x372.png 1170w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/social-channel-marketing-768x244.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1244px) 100vw, 1244px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/www.woopra.com\/analytics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Quantifiable metrics tend to cluster into four main groups: customers, product, positioning, and financial.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Customer metrics revolve around setting objectives that aim to improve acquisition, value, and retention.<\/li>\n<li>Product metrics tend to focus onpricing, adoption, and development.<\/li>\n<li>In terms of competitive positioning, your firm may be seeking to increase your market share or build your reputation.<\/li>\n<li>Financial goals could include improvement of customer equity or better ROI for tools you use.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Once you have defined your goals and set out clear metrics, you can build a structured marketing strategy.

In this respect, grouping clients together enables you to better understand the common needs of each group and target those needs accordingly.<\/p>\n<p>Through target market segmentation, your law firm can more clearly identify why new clients are coming to you, what their aims are, and the approach they prefer. By understanding these factors, you can concentrate your marketing efforts and resources on the areas which are having the greatest impact on your caseload and other bottom-line metrics.<\/p>\n<p><strong>There are two main ways to identify your key target market:<\/strong><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Study your current customer base<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Which type of person employs your legal services and what are they hoping to achieve? Create profiles based on your clients\u2019 demographics, needs, and values. Attempt to understand what drew these clients to your company in the first place.

Try to identify the key successes in your competition\u2019s marketing strategy and the legal services they offer.

While you may practice law with a generalist approach, marketing like a specialist will attract customers with specific problems.<\/p>\n<p>Hone in on what each segment needs and offer this to them directly to prevent your company from appearing like a \u2018jack of all trades\u2019.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3><span id=\"Get_More_Legal_Clients-2\">Get More Legal Clients<\/span><\/h3><p><p>Contact HigherVisibility today to see how we could propel your law firm&#8217;s online presence with a solid legal marketing plan to boost your client base.<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2><span id=\"Law_Firm_Marketing_Strategy_4_Optimize_Your_Law_Firm_Website\">Law Firm Marketing Strategy #4: Optimize Your Law Firm Website<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Studies have shown that 75% of people judge a company\u2019s credibility based on the quality of its website, proving that your law firm\u2019s website is a key marketing tool.<\/p>\n<p>Not only does it serve as an informative platform to outline your ethos, values, and legal services, your website also works as a lead generation funnel.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Law_firm_website_optimization_best_practices\">Law firm website optimization best practices:<\/span><\/h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Leverage effective <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/what-is-seo\/\">search engine optimization<\/a> (SEO) tactics<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>By engaging in SEO, you can increase search engine rankings and enhance the visibility of your services.<\/p>\n<p>In this vein, your law firm\u2019s website should speak both to humans and Google.<\/p>\n<p>To support human readability, SEO techniques should enable <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/seo-spiders\/\">Google\u2019s SEO spiders<\/a> to quickly scan your law firm\u2019s website (in order to rank it accordingly).

Technical SEO<\/span><\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/technical-seo-audit-process-anyone-can-follow\/\">Technical SEO<\/a> pertains to the techniques that enable a search engine to discover your law firm\u2019s website and understand what it is about. Conquering <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/how-to-fix-the-most-common-technical-seo-issues-on-wordpress\/\">technical SEO<\/a> enables search engines to map your website and rank it to the appropriate search terms in Google.<\/p>\n<p>Practically, this means ensuring that all titles and headings are chock-full of keywords. Tools like the free <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/free-seo-tools\/ctr-tool\/\">CTR Tool<\/a> are ideal for helping you craft strong title tags. Equally, meta descriptions and alt tags need to be filled with appropriate keywords to complement those used in the website\u2019s content.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13911\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/ctr-tool.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"525\" height=\"330\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/free-seo-tools\/ctr-tool\/\">(Image Source)<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"2_On-Page_SEO\">2. On-Page SEO<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>On-Page SEO refers to the content used on your law firm&#8217;s website. This includes everything from the descriptions of legal services through to your business blog. To stay relevant with Google, your content stream must be updated regularly.<\/p>\n<p>While keyword stuffing may have worked in the past, Google\u2019s algorithms now search for engaging content that\u2019s useful to the reader.<\/p>\n<p>For your law firm, this may take the form of educational blogs that offer pro-bono advice, case studies to highlight your services, and unique insights directly from your professional legal teams.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"3_Off-Page_SEO\">3. Off-Page SEO<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Off-page SEO refers to your law firm&#8217;s online presence on third-party sources, such as backlinks and shares on social media. Google recognizes these links as recommendations from external parties and ranks these backlinks according to the visibility of the user posting them. For example, a viral social media post pinged across Facebook will carry far more weight than a spam posting on a legal forum.<\/p>\n<p>To incite higher quality backlinks, try to link with reputable media sources and find significant social media influencers to endorse your company.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Law_Firm_Marketing_Strategy_7_Contribute_Authoritative_and_Engaging_Content_to_the_Legal_Sector\">Law Firm Marketing Strategy #7: Contribute Authoritative and Engaging Content to the Legal Sector<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>As noted above, your content marketing strategy should contribute engaging information to the legal sector. Demonstrating your law firm as an authority on the niche topics surrounding your services helps to boost credibility and increase visibility.<\/p>\n<p>To improve your content marketing, let your readers decide what you write about. Ask your audience directly through surveys and email marketing campaigns, or use analytics tools (like Google Analytics) to measure the engagement of your posts. Whichever topics most hook the readers the most, double down on these strategies. You will likely find that content that connects with readers via analogies and real use cases tends to work the best.<\/p>\n<p>Always remember to write for your readers first and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/seo-writing\/\">Google second<\/a>. Search engine algorithms are smart enough to weed out \u2018black hat\u2019 content marketing aimed simply at improving rankings. Keep posts regular and ensure to re-post on various social media channels to attract a diverse target market.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Final_Thoughts\">Final Thoughts<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Harnessing digital marketing strategies to attract new clients to your law firm is no mean feat. The sheer volume of legal entities makes it difficult to rank highly on search engines and stand out on social media.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, optimizing your website and improving your online presence are a solid step forward. However, a far more valuable approach would be to employ an experienced marketing agency who have a comprehensive knowledge of law firm marketing strategies.<\/p>\n<p>With so many cases already cluttering your inbox, why bury yourself in the stress of marketing your law firm as well?
