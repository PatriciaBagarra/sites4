Since then, the term itself has seen a drop in popularity, but that doesn\u2019t mean the discipline \u201cis dead.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>As we\u2019ll see in the inbound marketing statistics, the tactics and channels that fall under the inbound umbrella are more popular than ever.<\/p>\n<p>Let\u2019s take a closer look at the latest data and see what it can tell us about what works and what doesn\u2019t in inbound marketing in 2021.<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Is_inbound_marketing_effective_in_2021\">Is inbound marketing effective in 2021?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Inbound marketing is still one of the most effective strategies for marketing a product or service in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Marketers aren\u2019t using the term less because the tactics or channels don\u2019t work. What we see instead is that the label is splitting up based on the media marketers use.<\/p>\n<p>For example, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/30-content-marketing-statistics-trends-data-strategy\/\">content marketing and SEO cover the general owned media strategy<\/a> of most companies. A classic case is writing relevant blog posts targeting search phrases popular among potential customers.<\/p>\n<p>Organic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/social-media-marketing\/\">social media marketing<\/a> covers the other aspect of owned media; your company\u2019s social profiles.<\/p>\n<p>Video marketing covers platforms like YouTube and TikTok, as well as on-site video. It\u2019s a subsection of two channels, singled out because the medium has unique requirements.<\/p>\n<p>So far, it looks like inbound marketing is alive and well. Plus, social media platforms are still growing.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15490\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/social-around-the-world.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"624\" height=\"351\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/social-around-the-world.png 624w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/social-around-the-world-75x43.png 75w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em>(<a href=\"https:\/\/datareportal.com\/reports\/digital-2020-july-global-statshot\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Image Source<\/a>)<\/em><\/p>\n<p>With an influx of smartphone users, the potential audience digital channels can reach is now even more substantial.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>There were 3.96 billion active social media users in 2020.
