The idea of search engine optimization may not be a foreign concept, but a successful execution can be complicated work. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here we\u2019re going to break down key concepts like head terms and referring domains and show you how they play out in six competitive industries. If you\u2019re looking to increase your site\u2019s search rankings and traffic, continue reading to see how you can make SEO work for you.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Creativity_in_Your_Domain\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Creativity in Your Domain <\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10175\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/The-Most-Exclusive-Industries.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"2049\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/The-Most-Exclusive-Industries.png 800w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/The-Most-Exclusive-Industries-195x500.png 195w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/The-Most-Exclusive-Industries-768x1967.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/The-Most-Exclusive-Industries-156x400.png 156w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sometimes building your web presence can be difficult, and when major competitors are among the highest ranked webpages in search engine results, it can seem even more complicated. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the six major industries researched, there was a greater presence of unique domains in some areas. Of the 50 highest ranked sites when searching for key legal terms, there were 39 unique domains, such as divorcenet.com, rocketlawyer.com, and lawyers.findlaw.com.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other industries, like online education, wedding-based sites, and travel, had a similar level of diversification, suggesting <\/span><b>no one or two companies have a hold on the web presence of these industries. <\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the other end of the spectrum, of the top 50 sites for auto insurance, there were only 16 unique domains. With big players in the auto insurance game, their web presence takes up the bulk of top spots when searched for, making auto insurance a harder field to create visibility for smaller or different brands. Ranking the highest for insurance providers were thegeneral.com, progressive.com, and libertymutual.com. Sorry, statefarm.com!<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Popular_Home_Pages\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Popular Home Pages <\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10176\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/The-Root-of-all-Domains.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1509\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/The-Root-of-all-Domains.png 800w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/The-Root-of-all-Domains-265x500.png 265w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/The-Root-of-all-Domains-768x1449.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/The-Root-of-all-Domains-212x400.png 212w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If there\u2019s room in your industry for competitive online marketing, expanding your web presence to capitalize on as many points of entry as you can is a smart way to increase traffic and expand your sphere of customer influence. Once you do, what becomes more popular \u2013 your homepage or the subdirectories that expand on your landing page?<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We found <\/span><b>businesses focused on auto insurance, legal services, and online education were industries where the homepage accounted for almost a third of their top ranked sites.<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> For companies in these fields, your homepage is more likely to account for a higher percentage of your search traffic and should be used to introduce customers to the most important services and products your brand offers. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You can begin to break this down even further by industry to see how many of the popular keyword searches connected internet users with homepages. For example, if you were rent.com, one of the top domains in the real estate industry, you\u2019d be competing with the 80 percent of results for \u201creal estate listings\u201d pulling unique homepages These searches become less populated with these domains when you start to narrow your focus, i.e. looking to buy condos returns results where only 10 percent are homepages.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Other_Ways_to_Gain_Traffic\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Other Ways to Gain Traffic <\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10177\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Backlink-Profiles.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"982\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Backlink-Profiles.png 800w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Backlink-Profiles-407x500.png 407w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Backlink-Profiles-768x943.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Backlink-Profiles-326x400.png 326w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your site\u2019s total traffic isn\u2019t just composed of direct online searches or clicks to your homepage page. There can be <\/span><b>significant viewership opportunities from other <\/b><b>referral sources<\/b> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">like referring domains and backlinks. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Referring domains are other sites that bring you traffic, and backlinks are the links a customer clicks on from these domains to be brought to yours. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to where the most value is located, either with links to your homepage or your ranking URL, it\u2019s pretty clear it isn\u2019t just about first place. In several scenarios, such as online education, there were more linking domains for both the homepage and the ranking URL as the list progresses. This goes to show that there is more to ranking than just referring domains.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Using_Key_Search_Terms_on_Your_Webpage\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Using Key Search Terms on Your Webpage <\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10178\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Hardcoding-Head-Terms.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"1846\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Hardcoding-Head-Terms.png 800w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Hardcoding-Head-Terms-217x500.png 217w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Hardcoding-Head-Terms-768x1772.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/Hardcoding-Head-Terms-173x400.png 173w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Key search terms are one of the main ways to ensure your potential customers are making their way to your website. However, <\/span><b>there are certain words or phrases that will spark more competition<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> depending on your industry.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Top travel websites mention \u201ccar rental\u201d over 35 times on average within the main page and as a part of the code. While it may be lucrative or a great value-add to include links to car rentals, trying to improve your rank with this specific keyword could prove to be a challenging endeavor. It would be easier to try and target terms less frequently in both locations, such as \u201ccheap flights,\u201d where on average it is found less than 10 times on a page and fewer than 20 mentions in the HTML code.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Similar to travel, top real estate websites employ a few keywords on the page and in the code. \u201cReal estate agent\u201d is the most frequently mentioned phrase in the code constructing the site and throughout the page\u2019s contents. Other popular phrases within the real estate sector are \u201capartments for rent,\u201d which receives more attention in the website code, compared with \u201chomes for sale\u201d which receives more callouts in the main page text.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re thinking about including these terms in either your webpage or its code, full search terms may be more beneficial in helping to boost your search ranking than trying to create a play on those words and wedging them into your page\u2019s layout.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Straight_to_the_Point\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Straight to the Point <\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-10179\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/URL-Terms.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"2438\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/URL-Terms.png 800w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/URL-Terms-164x500.png 164w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/URL-Terms-768x2340.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/04\/URL-Terms-131x400.png 131w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When it comes to settling on a homepage or even subdomains for popular pages, adding<\/span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">part of a search term to your URL, or even composing your URL entirely from these words, can earn more clicks and higher search optimization. Because keywords, like search terms, can show up in general search results, <\/span><b>they may help with placement and user credibility on deciding which pages to open<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But this isn\u2019t a guarantee. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Over 50 percent of the top ranked search results for the keywords above with only a partial match in the URL (i.e. you search for \u201conline education,\u201d but the URL only contains \u201ceducation\u201d) had a below-average match to the phrase. For example, two of the top results in different industries \u2013 auto insurance and real estate \u2013 typically averaged less of a match than the four other fields of business. However, these are the outliers for the top-ranked spot: The other four matched 100 percent.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you\u2019re looking for that coveted No. 1 spot, work on connecting that URL back to the search terms for as close a match as possible to the search phrase you\u2019re looking to appear beneath in various search engines.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Methodology\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Methodology<\/span><\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All data were pulled from <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/www.semrush.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">semrush.com<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.
