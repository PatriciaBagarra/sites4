It\u2019s all about getting creative to try and produce a successful SEO strategy that doesn\u2019t involve link building. In one sentence, the moral of the story is really this: You want to be able to determine the most relevant topics for your content so that others will want to link back to your article, naturally.<\/p>\n<p>Social media helps give you data and inspire ideas for the content you want to publish on your site. In the past marketers would complete keyword research to see how people are searching, write content accordingly, and share that content on their social networks. With link building through guest blogging out of the question (learn more here), and Google\u2019s new encrypted data (learn more here), turning to different tools and social media data is crucial. IFTTT is one of the better tools I\u2019ve seen to put all of these new thoughts into motion.<\/p>\n<h2><b>How IFTTT Works and Why It Matters<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>IFTTT is an \u201cif this then that\u201d type tool that will help you look for certain triggers and then create what they call a \u201crecipe.\u201d The triggers are almost all related to social media, and once you pick your trigger you can also pick the action that you want to happen because of that trigger. <i><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">If <\/span><\/i>this trigger happens <i><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">then <\/span><\/i>this will happen. Beyond setting up these recipes, you don\u2019t have to worry about anything. The \u201cif\u201d and \u201cthen\u201d words aren\u2019t always used, but the concept is always there. Consider some of the following examples:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><i>Emails you label \u201cto do\u201d get added to an iOS reminders list. <\/i><\/li>\n<li><i>If we Instagram a photo, it will also post to Twitter. <\/i><\/li>\n<li><i>If you\u2019re tagged in a Google+ photo, automatically save it to your Google Drive account.<\/i><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The possibilities for recipes you can create truly seem endless. You have lots of opportunities to gather data; you just have to know what sort of data would be most beneficial for you. From an SEO standpoint, there are several ways you can really use this tool\u2019s services to your advantage, but below are the top two:<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><b>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/b><b>Generate content ideas. <\/b>If: Instagram. Then: Evernote.<\/p>\n<p>Of course the \u201cif\u201d and \u201cthen\u201d can be anything, but the idea here is to gather information that\u2019s happening across the social web in order to determine what you should write about on your blog\/website. For example, when you choose Instagram \u201cnew photo by anyone tagged\u201d as your trigger you are prompted to type in a tag, which could be a keyword where you are trying to rank. You can then choose Evernote as your reaction to that trigger and then all images posts to Instagram that have the keyword you typed into the tool will be saved directly to your Evernote account. This gives you a good idea of what is going on around Instagram all in one place.<\/p>\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><b>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 <\/b><b>Spend less time updating social. <\/b>If: Twitter. Then: Buffer<\/p>\n<p>You might want something you post to Twitter to also be posted on Facebook and Google+. You simply setup the recipe choosing Twitter as your trigger and then Buffer as your reaction. You setup the recipe once and you\u2019re done. You save time and you can then make sure your content is always shared across all of your platforms.<\/p>\n<p>I highly recommend checking out SEO professional Scott Kellam\u2019s article on ClickZ <a href=\"http:\/\/www.clickz.com\/clickz\/column\/2293592\/leveraging-ifttt-for-seo-and-social-media\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here<\/a> for a more detailed look at some of the different recipes you can setup to improve your SEO.<\/p>\n<p>All of this might make more sense if you go through the steps to getting started, so let\u2019s get right to it.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Getting Started with the IFTTT Tool<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>You simply visit <a href=\"https:\/\/ifttt.com\/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">this link<\/a> to get started. Type in a username and email, verify your email by clicking on a link that will be emailed to you, and you\u2019re set to go. Below are the steps you\u2019ll follow to get started:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Browse Recipes<\/b>. When you visit your dashboard, you will be prompted to choose a recipe. There are many \u201cpre-made\u201d recipes that you can browse. There is a \u201cbrowse\u201d button along the top of your page, or you can click the blue button you see in the screenshot below:<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\">\u00a0<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-4630\" alt=\"1\" src=\"\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/1.png\" width=\"538\" height=\"276\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/1.png 769w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/1-768x393.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 538px) 100vw, 538px\" \/><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Select a Recipe<\/b>. While browsing you might see a recipe that you like. For example, I saw a recipe someone created that said \u201cIf a new job is added by a company I follow, send me an email.\u201d As you can see, this is referring to something happening on LinkedIn and then gmail.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\">\u00a0<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-4631\" alt=\"2\" src=\"\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2.png\" width=\"615\" height=\"128\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2.png 769w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/2-768x160.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px\" \/><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Use Recipe<\/b>. Once you click the arrow to move forward, you simply activate your LinkedIn and Gmail channels (or whatever channels you want to use) by clicking a simple button and hit \u201cuse recipe.\u201d You then get an overview and can edit anything if needed (ex: Do you want the email to have a different subject line?).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-4632\" alt=\"3\" src=\"\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/3.png\" width=\"486\" height=\"402\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/3.png 608w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/3-606x500.png 606w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/3-484x400.png 484w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 486px) 100vw, 486px\" \/><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Create Your Own<\/b>. It\u2019s also worth mentioning that you can create your own recipe. If you think of an action you would want to happen as the result of another action, make up your recipe and you\u2019re set. All you need to do is visit the \u201ccreate\u201d tab at the top of your screen. You will then be able to customize everything (even down to a particular Craigslist post, which came in handy when looking for an employee).<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\">\u00a0<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter  wp-image-4633\" alt=\"4\" src=\"\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/4.png\" width=\"499\" height=\"342\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/4.png 713w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2014\/02\/4-583x400.png 583w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 499px) 100vw, 499px\" \/><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><b>Review Recipes<\/b>. At any time you can review all of your recipes and make changes very easily. You simply click the \u201cMy Recipes\u201d tab at the top of the page to see a page full of all your recipes. To can also turn them on and off if you only want them for certain periods of time.<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>All recipes are checked every 15 minutes so the tool is definitely quick.
