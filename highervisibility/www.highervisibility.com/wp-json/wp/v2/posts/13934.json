On the other hand, it means that there is little chance of encouraging an existing user to switch from their current brand to your cannabis products.<\/p>\n<p>However, the same study showed that 43% of non-users are curious about trying cannabis products (in this case CBD products). In this vein, targeting the canna-curious serves as a prosperous route to locking in life-long customers.<\/p>\n<p>In line with the advice above, approachable marijuana marketing and sales techniques that foster an educative approach are far more effective at enticing in inquisitive non-users.<\/p>\n<p>This means steering the cannabis purchasing experience away from the idea of sordid back-alley \u2018deals\u2019.

As social media influencers aren\u2019t technically advertising channels, they bypass the restrictions on PPC advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Since social advertising is a strict no-no, this limits Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest (etc) marketing campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>As a result, harnessing influencers on each of these social media platforms becomes the <a href=\"https:\/\/mjbizmagazine.com\/cannabis-influencers-can-get-around-advertising-restrictions\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">number one route<\/a> to reaching audiences across these social networks.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily, consumer behavior today relies heavily on the recommendation market.
