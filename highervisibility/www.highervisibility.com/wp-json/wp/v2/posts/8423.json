Backlinks = Votes of Confidence<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>In attempting to explain the importance of acquiring relevant, authoritative backlinks into your website, I often hear silence or muttering at the other end of the phone. Who knew that simply placing the word &#8216;back&#8221; in front of a concept that is seemingly universally understood, &#8216;link&#8217;, would lead to so much misunderstanding?\u00a0 I find that discussing backlinks in terms of their function is very helpful in establishing what they are in another&#8217;s mind.\u00a0 This is where &#8220;votes of confidence&#8221; comes into play.\u00a0 If one can understand that these websites linking to your site are vouching for your site to the search engines, one can begin to grasp the importance and role of backlinks in an SEO campaign.\u00a0 This simple metaphor helps do the trick of engendering a growing understanding of a key concept.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Alternate Metaphor = Popularity Contest<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Conversion Optimization = Billboard on the Side of the Highway<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Any (extremely) lazy optimizer can drive more traffic to a website.\u00a0 Heck, you can pay five bucks to boost your traffic overnight, and you don&#8217;t have to do any real SEO work.\u00a0 The catch is that it is highly doubtful that this traffic will lead to a conversion on your website.\u00a0 After all, the goal of a website is to guide a user to take some action, be it read an article, purchase a widget, vote on a picture, or fill out a contact form.\u00a0 To get this idea across, a coworker of mine uses the billboard analogy regularly.\u00a0 He says something like this: &#8220;Your website is like a billboard on the side of the road.\u00a0 People can drive past it all day long, but, if they don&#8217;t pull over and write down your information, what is the point of having the billboard?&#8221; His point is that having all the traffic in the world matters little unless those users are converting.\u00a0 I really like this analogy, and I have adopted it in my sales calls.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Alternate Metaphor = Restaurant menu<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Schema Markup = Writing your 11th Grade Term Paper<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is one of the more daunting challenges when it comes to SEO, and, to be honest, it took me several conversations with coworkers and family (Thanks, Mom) to come up with this one.\u00a0 Just mentioning this word, much less explaining it, will cause eyes to glaze over and minds to be numbed.\u00a0 So, and this is not a perfect analogy, think about when you had to write that high school term paper.\u00a0 You likely had to use footnotes, MLA Format, and proper quotation practices or your teacher marked you off.\u00a0 There were certain structures that you had to include in your paper to properly convey the meaning you wanted to convey to anyone reading it.\u00a0 In the same way, schema markup is a way of coding a website so that the search engines better understand its content. Obviously, this explanation isn\u2019t ground shaking in its intricacy, but this is the world of metaphor, so we are in the business of creating images, not math equations.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Alternate Metaphor = Please tell me if you know one<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>After writing my first two blog posts about SEO, much of the feedback that I have received from friends in family goes something like this: \u201cI loved your post, and you write great, but I have no idea what you are talking about.\u201d\u00a0 I can\u2019t help but think that if I am not going out of my way to help my client understand SEO, he or she is probably leaving our conversations with the same confusion.\u00a0 It doesn\u2019t have to be this way if we work hard to create analogies that explain our industry in terms of everyday things.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>While SEO is not rocket science or brain surgery, it certainly isn&#8217;t the
