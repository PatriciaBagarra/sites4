is the second most common reason for cart abandonment at the checkout.<\/p>\n<p>In fact, there\u2019s even a well-known story about how\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.punchkick.com\/blog\/2016\/05\/19\/ux-and-profitability\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">removing that barrier led to a $300 million increase in revenue<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Jared Spool from User Interface Engineering was hired by a major retailer to improve its online store.<\/p>\n<p>The retailer had a checkout flow that required the customer to either create a new account or log into an existing account in order to complete their purchase.<\/p>\n<p>The idea behind this was that creating an account would allow the customer to check out faster in the future and thus make shopping easier.<\/p>\n<p>However, when Spool looked at the data, it turned out that 45% of all customers had registered several accounts, presumably because they couldn\u2019t remember whether they had one already.<\/p>\n<p>Moreover, customers were submitting 160,000 forgotten password requests a day, and 75% of those requests did not lead to a purchase.<\/p>\n<p>It became clear that instead of making the customer\u2019s life easier, the registration requirement was an obstacle that prevented them from completing their order.<\/p>\n<p>Spool then replaced the \u201cRegister\u201d button with a \u201cContinue\u201d button and added a disclaimer to let the customers know that creating an account was not necessary to make a purchase.<\/p>\n<p>This led to a drastic increase in sales which translated to $300 million in additional revenue in one year.<\/p>\n<p>In short, requiring people to register in order to buy your products is a bad idea, and if you are currently doing that, it\u2019s probably costing you a lot of money. Stop it.<\/p>\n<p>However, you want customers to create accounts because that allows you to collect data that you can then use to streamline and personalize their shopping experience. So what should you do?<\/p>\n<p>The best approach is to provide the customers with an option to register while also letting them check out as guests.<\/p>\n<p>For example, MVMT has an \u201cAccount\u201d tab in their homepage navigation, and if you hover over it you will be presented with the login and sign up options:<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13187\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/mvmt-770x324.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"770\" height=\"324\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/mvmt-770x324.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/mvmt-768x323.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/mvmt-950x400.png 950w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/mvmt.png 1351w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 770px) 100vw, 770px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mvmtwatches.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">(image source)<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, if you click on it, you will be taken to a page where you can find more information about customer accounts:<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13188\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/mvmt-account-619x500.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"619\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/mvmt-account-619x500.png 619w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/mvmt-account-768x621.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/mvmt-account-495x400.png 495w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/mvmt-account.png 1357w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 619px) 100vw, 619px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mvmtwatches.com\/account\/login\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">(image source)<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>However, if you don\u2019t have an account, you can always check out as a guest:<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-13189\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/mvmt-cart-731x500.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"731\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/mvmt-cart-731x500.png 731w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/mvmt-cart-768x525.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/mvmt-cart-585x400.png 585w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/mvmt-cart.png 1335w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 731px) 100vw, 731px\" \/><\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><em><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mvmtwatches.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">(image source)<\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p>What is the lesson here?

The more fields a form has, the more likely it is to be abandoned. And most checkouts have way too many fields.<\/p>\n<p>When Baymard Institute conducted a checkout usability study,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/baymard.com\/blog\/checkout-flow-average-form-fields\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">they discovered that the average checkout flow has 14.88 form fields<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYet our checkout usability testing also reveals that most sites can achieve a 20-60% reduction in the number of form fields displayed by default.<\/p>\n<p>In short: the average checkout display twice as many form fields as needed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But how can you reduce the number of form fields in your checkout flow?<\/p>\n<p>The most important thing is to only ask for necessary information and nothing else.<\/p>\n<p>For example, online stores sometimes ask customers for details like title, middle name, company name, etc. But do they really need all that? Probably not.<\/p>\n<p>Also, according to Baymard,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/baymard.com\/blog\/checkout-flow-average-form-fields\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">even optional fields add friction to the checkout flow<\/a>:<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile it\u2019s true that users aren\u2019t required to fill out the optional fields, users won\u2019t realize this until they progress to that field and see its \u2018optional\u2019 label. Hence, when users first glance over the page, the optional fields are as intimidating as the required fields (because the user has yet to distinguish the two), and can thus make a checkout step seem more intimidating to complete than it actually is.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s best to remove every field that isn\u2019t necessary for fulfilling an order.<\/p>\n<p>Baymard also suggests these additional tweaks to reduce the number of form fields further:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Instead of having separate \u201cFirst Name\u201d and \u201cLast Name\u201d fields use a single \u201cFull Name\u201d field.<\/li>\n<li>Use the shipping address as the billing address by default and hide the \u201cBilling address\u201d section behind a link.<\/li>\n<li>Hide all other fields that are not required but may sometimes be needed behind links (e.g., \u201cAddress Line 2\u201d, \u201cCompany Name\u201d, etc.).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>They used Crutchfield\u2019s checkout as an example of a well-designed checkout flow. It only has eight form fields.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cAn entire checkout flow can be as short as 6-8 form fields. Here Crutchfield\u2019s 8-field checkout flow is shown.
