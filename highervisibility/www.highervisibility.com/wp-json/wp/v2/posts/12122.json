When you incorporate interactive content, you can increase time spent on your site.<\/p>\n<p>Also, it helps to break up your content marketing strategy from having strictly content. Consumers want a variety of choices for how they consume their content.<\/p>\n<p>Yet, only 10 percent of marketers incorporate gamification. The reason for a limited number of marketers using gamification might be due to the cost and resources required.<\/p>\n<p>If you have the ability, it can improve traffic when you invest in gamification. This isn&#8217;t just about running contests periodically. The objective should be to foster motivational campaigns that takes your target buyer on an interactive journey. And, this starts by having a pre-determined goal in mind.<\/p>\n<p>If you are interested in maximizing revenue, then how can a customized game contribute toward achieving that goal? Consumers are already busy, so you want a strategic method that they will find worthy of their time.<\/p>\n<p>Then, you must consider your metrics. How can you tell if your games are working? You must set up metrics to determine gamification success.<\/p>\n<p>Customers enjoy the instant gratification aspect of gamified elements such as badges, leaderboards, points and even rewards they can use for real products and services. People are also motivated by a need to accomplish goals. So, your games can set specific and achievable targets to build on that momentum.<\/p>\n<p><em>\u201cGames are the only force in the known universe that can get people to take actions against their self-interest, in a predictable way, without using force.\u201d <strong>\u2015 Gabe Zichermann<\/strong><\/em><\/p>\n<p>Also, since consumers are now more involved in the process, they are also more likely to remember the content.

When a consumer trusts your company, they are more likely to continue visiting your site and engaging with your content.<\/p>\n<p>You have something unique to share with the world, but audiences must believe your content is authentic. There are several ways to do this including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keeping a schedule (Consumers value consistency)<\/li>\n<li>Maintaining the same voice (builds a connection)<\/li>\n<li>Link to your sources and statistics (helps to prove credibility)<\/li>\n<li>Share real-life examples of success with actual customers<\/li>\n<li>Produce high-quality and relevant content<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you follow the above suggestions, your site will earn trust and a loyal following too.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"20\">\n<li><strong>69 percent of marketers prefer content to public relations and direct mail.

Consequently, once your direct mail piece is sent out&#8211;it often gets thrown away.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, you&#8217;ll have to change the design frequently just to garner a bit of excitement.

The more articles you have, the better your chances are of being found online.<\/p>\n<p>Plus, it builds trust when you have a long-standing blog. Also, by linking your pieces to other blog posts on your site, you can continually attract new traffic.<\/p>\n<p>If you have high-quality content, then it can improve conversions&#8211;especially with the right CTAs.
