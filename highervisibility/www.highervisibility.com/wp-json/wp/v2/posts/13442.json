Can\u2019t you just learn on the job? Is it truly important to invest in SEO training? And if you do want to train, what are some of the best free and paid courses that you can take to further your knowledge?<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"Why_Beginners_Should_Take_SEO_Courses\">Why Beginners Should Take SEO Courses<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>Much like any technical profession, SEO requires a lot of training. It is no longer the new kid on the marketing block (like social media), and it has become essential for content marketers to have a working knowledge of SEO and how it works.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s because SEO is a complicated and evolving process which combines elements of content writing with web design to create a layered and multi-faceted campaign that must be constantly managed and nurtured.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to have a career in the SEO industry, you need to develop an intense focus on Google\u2019s search algorithm and how it changes over time. Google is constantly shifting its parameters, so as an SEO professional, it\u2019s up to you to adapt the content of your clients to ensure that you\u2019re doing everything you can to maintain and enrich their ranking.<\/p>\n<p>You have to understand how Google judges sites and how to stay ahead of changes the company makes.<\/p>\n<p>This is true whether you\u2019re new yourself or you have a new team member joining your company who needs more training.<\/p>\n<p>To that end, training courses are perfect for beginners to learn practical knowledge and test themselves before being thrust into a position they\u2019re not prepared for.<\/p>\n<p>Failing to provide accurate training for an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/seo-specialists\/\">SEO specialist<\/a> could lead to major mistakes being made which negatively impact the overall campaign. Unfortunately, the penalty for such an occurrence is usually that the person is terminated.<\/p>\n<p>Remember, every job involves extensive training whether you\u2019re a plumber, <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WordPress developer, <\/span>or a Wall Street executive. Why should a process that has become the backbone of the marketing industry be any different?<\/p>\n<h2><span id=\"The_Importance_of_Investing_in_Training\">The Importance of Investing in Training<\/span><\/h2>\n<p>When looking at the world of search engine optimization, it\u2019s easy to question why you should have to invest your own money into training classes. When you break down the numbers, you\u2019ll find that paying into an SEO future can be a very smart investment based solely on your return.<\/p>\n<p>SEO courses vary in costs (more on that in a moment.) However, most of them are either free or cost up to $1,000. While the latter figure might make your legs wobble, it\u2019s important to look at the industry as a whole before making a snap judgment.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-13446\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/seo-training-importance.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1025\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/seo-training-importance.png 1025w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/seo-training-importance-770x433.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/seo-training-importance-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/seo-training-importance-712x400.png 712w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/seo-training-importance-75x43.png 75w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1025px) 100vw, 1025px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>SEO Specialists are in high demand in today\u2019s market.

It is primarily a beginner course offering two paid plans.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The first and more expensive option is a full SEO fundamentals certification course priced at $599. It provides foundational knowledge which prepares students for common SEO projects. It is led by instructors.

All purchases grant access to the video course and materials for a period of one year.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The reviews for Moz\u2019s <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO Training Course<\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are mostly positive.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for accessibility, Moz\u2019s course can be completed on mobile platforms, including iPhone, iPad, or any Android device. <\/span><\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"ClickMinded\">ClickMinded<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>ClickMinded is a premium SEO course that is priced at $487. The difference between ClickMinded and many of the free services on this list becomes apparent when you look at the large amount of content that it offers.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.clickminded.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ClickMinded\u2019s SEO course<\/a> includes more than five hours of content split between 66 different lectures.

This is a certificate program offered through the University of San Francisco, and as such, it is the most expensive item on this list at $1,980 for one course.<\/p>\n<p>The course features eight different SEO related topics, each one composed of six different lectures, meaning you\u2019re getting a lot of content for such a hefty price tag.<\/p>\n<p>Coursework for this program also includes preparation for the Google Ads Certification exam, which is a huge deal in the marketing world. Receiving Adwords certification is a massive feather in your cap and makes you more appealing to businesses, not only to manage their SEO efforts but also to run Google Ads on a pay-per-click basis.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Online_Marketing_Institute_SEO_Certification\">Online Marketing Institute: SEO Certification<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>Online Marketing Institute offers an SEO Certification program that is composed of five different parts.<\/p>\n<p>On top of coursework, a final Exam is available after all of the classes have been completed.

The first is a monthly fee of $67, or if you have the money upfront, you can pay a lower cost of $859 one time for the entire course. This is perfect for students who don\u2019t have as much disposable income on hand, allowing them to pay as they go until the course is completed.<\/p>\n<p>While you are left to your own devices to complete the course, there is a time limit in place. You are given a period of six months to complete all of the classes and the final exam immediately following your enrollment.<\/p>\n<p>It should also be noted that these classes all vary in terms of timing. Each class is somewhere between 20 and 70 minutes in length.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"Google_Search_Engine_Optimization_Starter_Guide\">Google Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>This is a <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/7451184?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">free SEO guide offered up by Google<\/a>. Note that it is described as a guide and not a course. That\u2019s because this is an educational chapter-based tutorial and not an actual course with classroom work.<\/p>\n<p>Google gives you 12 \u201cchapters\u201d to read through in order to enrich your knowledge of the SEO process and how it works.<\/p>\n<p>They go into detail explaining the process offering a very basic take on what SEO is and how you can get started on optimizing content.<\/p>\n<p>It should also be noted that this tutorial covers Google only, so if you\u2019re looking to optimize content for Amazon, Apple, Bing, or Yahoo, you\u2019ll have to look elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>As this is not a course, there is no certificate of completion offered at the end and no testing. The entire tutorial can be completed in one sitting. While this is not the best route for forging an education in the SEO field, it is a good starting point. What\u2019s more, you\u2019re being educated by Google itself, which is huge.<\/p>\n<p>It is highly recommended that SEO specialists review this content, even as an extra boost to their education following the completion of a certification program.<\/p>\n<h3><span id=\"QuickSprout\">QuickSprout<\/span><\/h3>\n<p>QuickSprout is another tutorial, not an actual certification course.
