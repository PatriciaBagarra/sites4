You may be too busy to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/website-design\/\">design a website<\/a>, so you hire a home builder website design service.<\/p>\n<p>The right website design can help you get more clients without a ton of work. Whether you hire someone or want to design your website yourself, consider these web design tips.<\/p>\n<h2>Focus on Your Branding<\/h2>\n<p>When designing your home builder website, take the time to consider <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/branding\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">your brand<\/a>. Your brand includes your business name, logo, colors, fonts, and voice. If you can include these elements on your website, you will make it easier for potential clients to learn about your company.<\/p>\n<p>Branding can help you differentiate yourself from other industries and home builders. For example, you can use natural colors or a logo that looks like wood to reflect that you build homes. The clearer you can make your branding, the easier you can target potential customers.<\/p>\n<h2>Set Up Your Navigation Bar<\/h2>\n<p>Next, determine what to include in your home builder website navigation bar. The bar sits at the top of your page and allows visitors to go to different pages. Your navigation bar should consist of links to your service page, about page, and contact page.<\/p>\n<p>You can include your homepage first so that visitors know how to get back to it. If you have a blog, you can also add that to the navigation bar, but you don\u2019t have to have a blog on your website. You can customize the layout in a content management system, like WordPress.<\/p>\n<h2>Use a Descriptive Headline<\/h2>\n<p>On your homepage, think about a headline to go above the body of the page. Typically, your headline describes your services, and when you include the term \u201chome builder,\u201d it helps your potential customers know what you do.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re trying to convey a casual or formal brand, customizing your headline to make it eye-catching is an excellent way to draw attention.<\/p>\n<p>Good options for headlines include questions that spark interest, your personal tagline, or even a customer testimonial.<\/p>\n<h2>Answer Common Questions<\/h2>\n<p>Good website design should be easy to use. If your customers have to work hard to find answers, they may be <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/analytics\/answer\/1009409?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">tempted to leave<\/a>. To keep customers from leaving your site, make sure your content answers common questions and clearly describes what you do as a home builder.<\/p>\n<p>When building a custom website, consider listing the services you offer, company history, experience, and essential contact information.<\/p>\n<p>Blogs are another great way to answer frequently asked questions about your services or other topics related to your home building business.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>MOST HOME BUILDERS STRUGGLE WITH GENERATING NEW CLIENTS...WE FIX THAT!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many home builders grow their business. Let us do it for you!<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>Share Pictures<\/h2>\n<p>Including actual pictures from your projects is a great way to showcase your services and talents. Consider including a portfolio of in-progress photos as well as before and after. It\u2019s a good idea only to include <a href=\"https:\/\/photographylife.com\/how-to-take-good-pictures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">high-quality photos<\/a> that highlight the best aspects of your work.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have a batch of photos from a recent project, a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/web-design-pricing\/\">website designer<\/a> can put them on your website. You can show your customers what you\u2019ve done, and that can give them an idea of what you might do for their house.<\/p>\n<p>As you complete more projects, a design team can swap out older photos for more recent ones. Your clients can then see how you improve with each house.<\/p>\n<h2>State Your Location<\/h2>\n<p>Any home builder website design should highlight your location. Whether your company has one main service area or different locations, you should make that known. Include the information on each of your main pages and in your website footer.<\/p>\n<p>Even if you don\u2019t have a brick and mortar office where customers can visit, it\u2019s important to include a mailing address, contact information, and the areas you serve. Then, add your service area to your website. You can add your city to the title of your site, and that can help even more.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have your location in your website title, having your location somewhere, such as in your social media marketing, will help attract local customers.<\/p>\n<h2>Include Buttons<\/h2>\n<p>Your home builder website doesn\u2019t need to be boring. You can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.smashingmagazine.com\/2019\/02\/buttons-interfaces\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">add buttons<\/a> to your homepage or other pages to help link customers to your service page. Buttons stand out more than simply hyperlinking to a different page within the text.<\/p>\n<p>You can make the button\u2019s color match that of your brand, so you can make your whole site more cohesive. Your web designer can help you create buttons to increase conversion rates and improve eCommerce sales for your business.<\/p>\n<p>A button can also make your website easier to browse on mobile devices. That way, you don&#8217;t have to rely on digital marketing on just computers.<\/p>\n<h2>Add Calls to Action<\/h2>\n<p>As a home builder, you want people to book your services or get a quote. Adding buttons to your homepage or blog can make that goal more apparent to readers.<\/p>\n<p>On your homepage, you can emphasize your services to get people with a new home to visit your service page for more information. You can also mention you give quotes before starting a project, and you can link to your contact page.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be afraid to add multiple <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thebalancesmb.com\/call-to-action-1794380\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">calls to action<\/a> (CTAs) throughout your site and a single page. That can help make your site more user-friendly because people can always find a way to your service page.<\/p>\n<h2>Prioritize Your Service Page<\/h2>\n<p>While all home builder websites should be unique, they all have a similar goal. If you want to book more clients, you need to get more people to visit your service page. Make that the central goal for any other web page you create or any blog post you publish.<\/p>\n<p>You can encourage people to read about your business on your about page or you can link from your about page to your services. No matter how many steps it takes, your readers need to be on track to booking your services.<\/p>\n<p>Next, avoid linking away from your service page. If you want to include a link on that page, have it <a href=\"https:\/\/www.freecodecamp.org\/news\/how-to-use-html-to-open-link-in-new-tab\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">open in a new tab<\/a>. That way, your visitors won&#8217;t end up at a new website without booking a free consultation with you.<\/p>\n<h2>Be Careful With Links<\/h2>\n<p>While you should link to your service page or the contact page to get people to book your services, be careful when linking elsewhere. You don\u2019t want to inadvertently send website traffic away from your services or to a different site.<\/p>\n<p>Your home and about pages can link to your service page. Each blog post can also link to your service or contact page. Try not to link to pages outside of your website unless it&#8217;s to your social media or an email marketing signup form.<\/p>\n<p>If you do want to link somewhere else to back up a claim in a blog post, you can. But make sure the source is neutral and isn\u2019t another home builder website. The last thing you want is to send clients to your competition.<\/p>\n<h2>Home Builder Website Design Tips<\/h2>\n<p>Home builder website design uses the same basic concepts as any other website. You have a goal for your visitors, which is to book your services. Everything you design and include on your site should be part of that goal.<\/p>\n<p>Keep these tips in mind to make your home builder website stand out and attract more clients. Then, you can grow your business and increase your revenue.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>MOST HOME BUILDERS STRUGGLE WITH GENERATING NEW CLIENTS...WE FIX THAT!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many home builders grow their business.
