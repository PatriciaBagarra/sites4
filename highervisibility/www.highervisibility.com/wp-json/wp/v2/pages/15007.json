Plastic surgeons carefully design their practice, from creating a comforting and welcoming waiting room to cultivating a warm staff, to scheduling appointments to minimize waiting time. You\u2019ll attract more patients if your online presence matches your physical presence.<\/p>\n<p>Your website is the first impression most patients will have of your practice. At HigherVisibility, we will ensure your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/website-design\/\">website design<\/a> attracts more traffic, converting curious searchers to paying patients. We use tried and tested marketing strategies and best practices to design your website and improve your bottom line.<\/p>\n<h2>Search Engine Optimization and Website Design<\/h2>\n<p>Search engine optimization (SEO) is an <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/what-importance-seo-digital-marketing-why-without-dead-bhanu-garg\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">essential part<\/a> of digital marketing. When a customer uses Google search, they will usually only see the first ten results.<\/p>\n<p>A page optimized for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO<\/a> uses specific keywords to achieve a higher ranking in the Google search engine, meaning that more potential patients will see your website, resulting in more click-throughs. When potential clients type in, &#8220;plastic surgeon near me,&#8221; or, &#8220;plastic surgeon in [location],&#8221; you want your website on the first page of Google, not the last.<\/p>\n<p>Part of using SEO effectively is creating a website that promotes good search engine optimization techniques. Using the tips below to help you, you can continue to publish new blogs to inform your patients about new procedures, answer FAQs about cosmetic surgery, and promote deals.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>MOST PLASTIC SURGEONS STRUGGLE WITH GETTING PATIENTS...WE FIX THAT!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many Plastic Surgeons grow strategically. Let us do it for you!<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>What Makes a Good Website Design<\/h2>\n<p>Website design is more sophisticated than choosing your favorite font and color scheme today. There are many aspects to consider, including style, functionality, user experience, and compatibility.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-14989\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/plastic-surgery-wordpress-website-design-774x400.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"774\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/plastic-surgery-wordpress-website-design-774x400.png 774w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/plastic-surgery-wordpress-website-design-770x398.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/plastic-surgery-wordpress-website-design-768x397.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/plastic-surgery-wordpress-website-design-1536x794.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/plastic-surgery-wordpress-website-design.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Functionality<\/h3>\n<p>Your website is, above all else, a business tool. You want to make it <a href=\"https:\/\/mashable.com\/2012\/02\/09\/website-must-haves\/?europe=true\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">easy to navigate<\/a> for your patients so they can quickly find your services, prices, qualifications, and contact information. A client may be interested in contacting you, but if your practice&#8217;s phone number is buried somewhere on your website, they may never make the call.<\/p>\n<p>If your hours change due to holidays or other reasons, you&#8217;ll want to make sure you regularly update them on your website as well.<\/p>\n<h3>Blogs<\/h3>\n<p>You can generate relevant content using a blog on your website. You can use your blogs to advertise new rhinoplasty procedures or discuss emerging research in the plastic surgery field. Blog posts are also a great way to attract potential clients, and you can include specific keywords in the blog to drive organic traffic from Google.<\/p>\n<p>Plastic surgery blogs often discuss topics relating to reconstruction, recovery time, and scarring questions. Some clients might have a plastic surgeon concern, and if one of your blog posts can answer that question, they could end up scheduling a consultation.<\/p>\n<h3>Domain and Host<\/h3>\n<p>At HigherVisibility, we don\u2019t believe in tying you down with a hosting contract. Although we do offer hosting services, you can also host your website using a third party. When designing, we prefer using WordPress for content-driven sites.<\/p>\n<p>When you sign your hosting contract, you\u2019ll also need to buy a domain name. Preferably, you want a website name that&#8217;s shorter and easy to spell. Some surgeons choose to highlight their city and specialization (Philadelphia plastic surgeon) while others prefer to use their last name.<\/p>\n<h3>Social Media<\/h3>\n<p>Reaching patients through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/social-media-marketing\/\">social media<\/a> is a critical aspect of digital marketing. More than <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pmc\/articles\/PMC5708107\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">40% of health care consumers<\/a> find their healthcare information on social media. Include links to all your social media accounts on your website.<\/p>\n<p>Social media is also a good place for you to advertise any of your site&#8217;s blog posts, as well as hours, location, and general services of your practice. Satisfied patients may also share your website on their own social media page, or share blog posts that they find on your website.<\/p>\n<h2>Creating the Perfect Plastic Surgery Practice Website<\/h2>\n<p>Your website is the face of your company, and it must be clean, easy to use, appealing, and searchable. While every practice has different needs, you can use the tips above to take your website design to the next level, and convert clicks into clients.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>MOST PLASTIC SURGEONS STRUGGLE WITH GETTING PATIENTS...WE FIX THAT!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many Plastic Surgeons grow strategically.
