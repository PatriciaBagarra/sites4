Unlike other digital marketing techniques, such as search engine optimization (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO<\/a>), which may require a long time to make an impact, the PPC marketing technique can allow you to start getting the attention of prospective clients almost instantly. However, it is imperative for you to understand that PPC advertising does not work in isolation. A successful PPC advertising campaign will require you to consider how other marketing channels might hinder or support your PPC efforts. Below is a rundown of some tips that lawyers can count on to get the most from their PPC advertising campaigns.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-14138 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/lawyer-with-client-e1588969920812.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"999\" height=\"506\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/lawyer-with-client-e1588969920812.jpg 999w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/lawyer-with-client-e1588969920812-770x390.jpg 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/lawyer-with-client-e1588969920812-790x400.jpg 790w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/lawyer-with-client-e1588969920812-768x389.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 999px) 100vw, 999px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Do Extensive Keyword Research<\/h2>\n<p>For you to create an effective PPC advertising campaign, you need to understand what keywords your prospective clients are using in their organic searches. You also have to find out how your competitors are using those keywords. You can do a Google search of the most relevant keywords that you have found for you to see the kind of ads your competitors have created around them. You can then take advantage of whatever weaknesses their ads have to create a campaign that is more appealing and persuasive.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14214\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/screenshot-ahrefs.com-2020.05.11-14_16_47.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1097\" height=\"708\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/screenshot-ahrefs.com-2020.05.11-14_16_47.png 1097w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/screenshot-ahrefs.com-2020.05.11-14_16_47-770x497.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/screenshot-ahrefs.com-2020.05.11-14_16_47-620x400.png 620w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/screenshot-ahrefs.com-2020.05.11-14_16_47-768x496.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1097px) 100vw, 1097px\" \/><\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most Law Firms Struggle with Generating New Clients...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many lawyers grow their practice. Let us do it for you!<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>Differentiate Yourself<\/h2>\n<p>If you have been in the legal professional for some time, you already understand how competitive the industry is. For you to get business, you have to convince your prospective clients that you are really good at what you do. However, that is basically what all your competitors will be doing in their own different ways. For you to beat this competition, your PPC campaign must focus on the things that make you better. Whether it is superior customer service, a great reputation, or free consultation, let whatever makes you stand out to be at the center of your campaign. You should then create an actionable call-to-action to spur new clients to act as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14215\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Google-PPC-Ads-for-Lawyers-Example-Search-Result.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"589\" height=\"484\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Google-PPC-Ads-for-Lawyers-Example-Search-Result.png 589w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/Google-PPC-Ads-for-Lawyers-Example-Search-Result-487x400.png 487w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 589px) 100vw, 589px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Set Up Your Geo-Targeting Correctly<\/h2>\n<p>This tip may sound like a no-brainer, but surprisingly, a lot of law firms are still targeting irrelevant geographical locations. However, the fact is that it is unlikely that people are going to travel further than they need to just to get legal services. As such, it is advisable for you to dig dip into your area for you to determine the exact radius that you should be targeting. If your law firm is operating in different localities, it is imperative for you to have a separate campaign for each area. Remember that each click is going to cost a significant amount to money, and therefore, targeting an irrelevant area is going to have a negative impact on your bottom line.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/webcdn-adespressoinc.netdna-ssl.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Ads_Manager-3.png\" alt=\"Are Geo-Targeting Facebook Ads Right for Your Business?\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Make Your Ads Relevant<\/h2>\n<p>The importance of relevancy in PPC advertising in all industries cannot be overemphasized. However, when it comes to the legal professions, relevancy can make or break an advertising campaign. For you to have a successful PPC advertising campaign for your law firm, you will need to have content that will speak to the intentions and the needs of prospective clients landing on your website. You can enhance the quality and believability of your content by linking your anchor texts to reliable sources.<\/p>\n<p>If a person finds your Ad copy by searching &#8220;How a personal injury lawyer can help me in a car accident case,&#8221; you will need to have relevant, high-quality content addressing the concerns that such a person may be having. If your content succeeds in answering their question adequately, they will have confidence in you and they may end up hiring you when they will need a lawyer. On the other hand, if you just focus on keywords without at the expense of relevant content to satisfy the curiosity of people coming to your website, your campaign may turn out to be a huge failure.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most Law Firms Struggle with Generating New Clients...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many lawyers grow their practice. Let us do it for you!<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>Prioritize Calls<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to PPC advertising for law firms, calls are very important. Indeed, experts agree that in some cases, a phone call is much more important compared to a click on a website. It is also true that some leads are going to be looking to talk to an attorney instantly. Therefore, there is no harm in driving more phone calls to your office via paid searches. There are several things that you can do to this end. For instance, you should put in place a 24\/7 answering service, track every call, ensure your phone number is present on all pages and make use of call extensions. Since calls are more valuable compared to website clicks, it is also wise for you to set up call-only campaigns.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14212\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/screenshot-www.alversonobrien.com-2020.05.11-14_04_57-e1589224014421.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"962\" height=\"700\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Get and Online Chat System<\/h2>\n<p>Every client in the legal industry is unique, and therefore, although most legal issues are generic, every case has some aspects that are unique to it. Therefore, not every question that a potential client is asking is going to be answered through FAQ&#8217;s or even videos. Therefore, it pays to have a chat system through which the more specific question that your prospective clients may be having can be addressed. This helps because not everyone is comfortable with making phone calls to law firms, and therefore, they may prefer talking to a law firm&#8217;s representative rather than calling a lawyer directly. It is true that although having a chat system is going to open your site to more noise, it has the potential to attract top quality leads and higher conversion rates.<\/p>\n<h2>Make Use of Videos<\/h2>\n<p>Most people looking for legal services do so over issues that mean so much to them. Therefore, they are going to be skeptical at first. What this means is that for you to get their trust, you will have to do more than just writing about your services on your landing pages. Adding videos to the landing pages will go a long way in convincing you potential clients that they can trust you. Surprisingly, creating such a video is extremely simple. All you have to do is sit in front of a camera and say what you do and the process of getting your services in without sounding salesy. Creating a video will give your firm a human face, and consequently make it more likely from people landing on your website to trust you.<\/p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.mankatowebdesign.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/12\/lawye-rvideos-1024x535.png\" alt=\"Law Firm Video Production in Minneapolis | Mankato Web Design\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Invest in Establishing a Memorable Brand<\/h2>\n<p>Branding is one thing that a lot of lawyers ignore. However, the truth is that in such a competitive industry, branding can really make a big difference. The importance of branding is that it will make it easier for your firm to stand out in the crowd. By creating a brand, people who have previously visited your website are going to easily remember and recognize your firm when they will need the services of a lawyer.<\/p>\n<h2>The Takeaway<\/h2>\n<p>Overall, it is apparent that if you would like to take your law firm to the next level, using Google AdWords (Ads) or Bing PPC is a marketing technique that you should start to invest in. However, it is important for you to remember that this marketing technique does not work in isolation. You have to work on other aspects of your company&#8217;s website and other communication tools to ensure that to make your campaign most effective. For instance, you have to work on developing more relevant content that will answer the questions that the prospective clients landing on a web page may be having. This way, you will be in a position to build trust and consequently get more quality leads.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most Law Firms Struggle with Generating New Clients...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many lawyers grow their practice.
