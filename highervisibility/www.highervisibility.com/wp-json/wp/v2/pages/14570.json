It\u2019s no surprise why it\u2019s so common among businesses: it\u2019s a winning, tried-and-true form of marketing.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to implement SaaS for your business, no matter how big or small, or if you&#8217;re interested in a SaaS product, we\u2019ve got strategies as well as a few tips and tricks to help you get started. Here\u2019s our guide to transforming into an SaaS business and perfecting your SaaS marketing strategies in 2021.<\/p>\n<h2>What Is SaaS?<\/h2>\n<p>As you might&#8217;ve guessed, there&#8217;s a plethora of benefits to SaaS business. With SaaS, the data you have can be accessed anywhere, from any device, so long as you have a stable internet connection. Software vendors are like the ones in charge \u2014 they\u2019re responsible for maintaining the databases and servers for an app.<\/p>\n<p>SaaS products don&#8217;t need hardware (so buyers can outsource the primary tech responsibilities), and SaaS is paid via a subscription-based model.<\/p>\n<h2>SaaS vs. \u2018The Cloud\u2019<\/h2>\n<p>The cloud usually refers to a broader concept of servers, databases, and computers that are connected so a user can gain easy access to their data. A private cloud shares computing power between the employees of a business, as opposed to sharing it with the general public. That being said, your IT team will need to handle all the upkeep and maintenance of a private cloud.<\/p>\n<p>Although all clouds are run via software, SaaS is the actual software apps that are used through the cloud. It\u2019s faster, easier, and less expensive for SaaS users. What\u2019s not to like about that?<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most SaaS Companies Struggle with Generating New Business...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many SaaS businesses grow strategically. Let us do it for you!<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>SaaS Companies and Data: Who Owns It<\/h2>\n<p>Nowadays, privacy is a consistent concern among not only those who surf the internet for fun but for businesses and companies, too. Usually, you\u2019ll own your own data, even though it\u2019s in a cloud. The majority of SaaS contracts will mention your right to the data. You\u2019ll also be able to back up your data and export it at any time.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re worried about safety, most software providers will do their best to show you just how safe your data will be in their cloud. Most providers only use highly secure cloud services, and the reality is your data is probably more at risk in-house.<\/p>\n<p>Even if your provider goes out of business, the data is still usually yours to keep.<\/p>\n<h2>Limitations of SaaS<\/h2>\n<p>In all honesty, there aren\u2019t many limitations to SaaS products. The only one that\u2019s worth mentioning is the fact that SaaS needs a reliable internet connection. However, most companies\u2019 internet connections are perfect for SaaS.<\/p>\n<p>Like other internet-based technologies, it\u2019s possible that there will be technical difficulties from time to time. However, some SaaS vendors have an \u201coffline\u201d mode so employees can continue to work even if the power or internet goes out.<\/p>\n<h2>SaaS Marketing Strategies<\/h2>\n<p>Although SaaS marketing strategies will vary based on your business and your aspirations for the company, there are still some key takeaways that your SaaS marketing team can improve with.<\/p>\n<h3>SaaS Marketing Flywheel<\/h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.hubspot.com\/flywheel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">flywheel<\/a> isn\u2019t an uncommon visualization tool. In fact, we\u2019ll use it to describe four simple steps \u2014 a clear cut business model \u2014 you can take to create a successful SaaS marketing strategy and get your company to the next level.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14574\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Funnel-to-Flywheel-Model.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"599\" height=\"445\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Funnel-to-Flywheel-Model.png 599w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Funnel-to-Flywheel-Model-538x400.png 538w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px\" \/><\/p>\n<h4>1. Attract<\/h4>\n<p>The first step of your SaaS marketing strategy should be to attract brand leads. To do this, let\u2019s start by talking about what metrics to track. You should know:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How many people visit your company\u2019s website<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The bounce rate \u2014 the percentage of people who visit your site but then leave instead of clicking around<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The conversion rate, from website visitor to brand lead<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h4>2. Engage<\/h4>\n<p>After the first step, we can move on to the second: engage. Let\u2019s say you\u2019ve hooked a potential customer. Now what? It&#8217;s time for the onboarding process.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll need to engage them so that you can sort them into your database. If it seems like you\u2019re on the same page as this new customer, perhaps get ready for a sale.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of engagement, you can take a look at email engagement \u2014 such as the click-through or open rate \u2014 and landing page interactions.<\/p>\n<h4>3. Close<\/h4>\n<p>For the third step, you might be less involved. Typically, a sales team will take over this phase. However, you should still be paying attention to factors like the customer lifetime value (CLTV) and the customer acquisition cost (CAC), if you can. These factors and the resulting teamwork between the two just goes to show how connected SaaS marketing and SaaS sales are.<\/p>\n<h4>4. Delight<\/h4>\n<p>Once you have new customers, the ultimate goal of SaaS marketing is to keep them coming back for more. You can do this by making your clients happy enough that they\u2019d recommend the business to a friend or family member.<\/p>\n<p>During this step of the process, you\u2019ll want to consider things like your online reviews (be them on your website or on Google), any potential subscription upgrades, and your net promoter score (NPS).<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most SaaS Companies Struggle with Generating New Business...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many SaaS businesses grow strategically. Let us do it for you!<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>SaaS Marketing Tips and Tricks<\/h2>\n<p>We also have some SaaS marketing tips and tricks that will help you continue to implement your business model and your SaaS marketing strategy to keep the company\u2019s growth.<\/p>\n<h3>Getting to Know Your Brand<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-14575 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/branding-in-the-digital-age-780x400.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"780\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/branding-in-the-digital-age-780x400.png 780w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/branding-in-the-digital-age-770x395.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/branding-in-the-digital-age-768x394.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/branding-in-the-digital-age-1536x788.png 1536w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/branding-in-the-digital-age-2048x1050.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>As a business, you probably understand how critical branding is to a company\u2019s success. However, now is a great time to reevaluate your brand and make sure it\u2019s not only still reflecting your aspirations for the business, but that it\u2019s also still relevant with your target audience.<\/p>\n<p>Because there\u2019s no \u201cphysical location\u201d with SaaS, you need to make sure your brand is SaaS-friendly, so to speak. If you\u2019re touching up your brand, take a close look at your design, personality, and messaging or the content that you churn out.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t have personas for your ideal target audience members, now would be an excellent time to create a few. People are born to appreciate a good narrative, so SaaS marketers will recommend that you flesh out these personas and highlight potential consumers\u2019 pain points.<\/p>\n<p>In a similar vein, feel free also to tell customer success stories \u2014 another form of narrative that resonates with audiences. Make sure with any narrative that you\u2019re using conversational, everyday language to connect with as many people as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, you want to pay special attention to your visual branding. That means high-quality photos, videos, and graphics that show your company\u2019s features. Having blurry or low-quality visual assets can make your business look unprofessional, and the lack of aesthetics can actually drive new customers away.<\/p>\n<h3>Optimizing Your Website<\/h3>\n<p>Even if you already have a functioning website, while you\u2019re integrating SaaS marketing strategies is a perfect time to revamp your site. Why? It\u2019s a fantastic way to engage with potential consumers and build a network. It\u2019s also an excellent strategy for attracting new customers in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>Your website will broadcast to potential customers how your company is better than competing companies. Remember those first two steps from the SaaS marketing flywheel, attract and engage? Well, your website will be a significant tool in successfully completely those first two steps. Is your landing page up to date? If not, update it.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t already include these on your site, consider adding:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customer testimonials with positive, enthusiastic quotes<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Blogging with SEO-friendly content<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Any honors or awards your company might\u2019ve earned<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Links to coverage of your company in the media<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A live chat options for customers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Generating Traffic through SEO<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-14577 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/seo-framework-1-648x400.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"648\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/seo-framework-1-648x400.jpg 648w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/seo-framework-1-770x475.jpg 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/seo-framework-1-768x474.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/seo-framework-1.jpg 1000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Generating traffic through search engine optimization (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO<\/a>) is more important than ever. The traffic you get through Google searches can lead to inbound marketing, in which new customers find your company themselves.<\/p>\n<p>People rarely click to the next page of Google search results, which means it\u2019s essential that your company ranks in the top search results. That\u2019s where <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/what-is-seo\/\">SEO<\/a> comes in.<\/p>\n<p>Although in the past, companies were able to pack their content full of SEO-friendly keywords to rank high with Google\u2019s algorithm, that\u2019s no longer enough.<\/p>\n<p>Google is intelligent enough to recognize which content is most valuable, so make sure you\u2019re organizing your content correctly and not practicing \u201ckeyword stuffing,\u201d which is precisely what it sounds like. If you churn out content that isn&#8217;t quality, it&#8217;s simply not worth it.<\/p>\n<p>Produce content on topics that your target audience is looking for.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most SaaS Companies Struggle with Generating New Business...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many SaaS businesses grow strategically. Let us do it for you!<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>Utilizing Social Media<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/social-media-marketing\/\">Social media<\/a> is, by far, one of the most crucial aspects of SaaS marketing. The truth of the matter is everyone uses social media, be it for personal or professional use. In order to know which social media platforms to utilize, take a deep dive into your target audience. Some safe bets as far as social channels go include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facebook<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">YouTube<\/li>\n<li>Instagram<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If your target audience happens to be those in their early 30s, 20s, or even younger, TikTok or Snapchat may be worthwhile social media platforms to invest in. After all, influencer marketing is a moneymaker for a good reason.<\/p>\n<p>You should also be sharing your blog posts and other content on social media in addition to consistently blogging, if you\u2019re not doing so already. Social media allows for conversation between the producer and the consumer, so you can better target your audience through feedback from people in your target audience.<\/p>\n<p>Social posts can be content-based, such as blogging, or they can be answers to FAQs. You can also engage the audience by posing open-ended questions and asking for honest feedback.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, make sure all your social media channels also include a link to your website&#8217;s landing page.<\/p>\n<h3>Taking Advantage of Paid Online Advertisements (and Inbound Marketing)<\/h3>\n<p>You might be familiar with Hubspot and its content marketing and inbound marketing expertise. Although inbound marketing is a great way to reach your target audience in a more organic way, adding paid online advertisements in addition to your marketing campaign can get your company to the next level.<\/p>\n<p>With paid online advertisements, you\u2019re effectively showcasing your company and its brand to targeted audiences. For example, depending on the ad platform, you\u2019ll be able to target potential customers based on their job titles or the industry they work on, which is perfect for SaaS marketing.<\/p>\n<p>Display ads \u2014 you might know them as banner ads \u2014 are one viable option. These are very common. You\u2019ll see them at the bottom, top, or sides of a webpage. They\u2019re comparable to billboards in that they usually have a concise message and maybe a visual.<\/p>\n<p>Pay-per-click (PPC) search ads are another excellent option. When you search for a term or phrase on Google, these are the ads you\u2019ll see. Depending on the word or phrase you search, the ads that are displayed should relate directly to what you\u2019re searching for. So if you employ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/ppc-management\/\">PPC<\/a> search ads and a potential customer clicks on one, they\u2019ll be redirected to your website.<\/p>\n<p>Video ads are pretty self-explanatory. They\u2019re best used on platforms like Vimeo or YouTube, although they also work with other social channels, like Twitter and Facebook.<\/p>\n<p>Paid social ads offer perhaps the most potential. Because social media is relevant to the majority of people\u2019s lives, paid social media ads are an excellent way to go. They\u2019re very useful in reaching potential customers and often blend into the user\u2019s social media dashboard because they\u2019re strewn in so organically.<\/p>\n<p>When using paid ads, some critical things to keep in mind include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The ad placement and which audience you\u2019re trying to target<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The content (are the videos, images, and graphics clear and high-quality?)<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">SEO-friendly keywords<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The type of advertisements are so diverse today, that you could even advertise via a podcast if you felt comfortable with that platform.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also want to pay special attention to the metrics once you start using paid online advertisements. Look at the cost per conversion, the cost per click, the click-through rate, and the conversion rate at the very least.<\/p>\n<h3>Lead Generation and Nurturing<\/h3>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14578\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/content_Lead_generation.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"650\" height=\"365\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/content_Lead_generation.png 650w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/content_Lead_generation-75x43.png 75w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>With SaaS marketing, one of the primary goals is usually to bring in new leads. Let\u2019s take a look at lead generation and how you can nurture those leads.<\/p>\n<h3>Free Trials<\/h3>\n<p>Although the concept of freemium is popular, if I could recommend only one lead generation tip, it would be to implement free trials into your service. Lots of businesses use free trials, and it\u2019s a great way to attract potential customers and show them what you have to offer in terms of your services and quality.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019d suggest experimenting with a two-week free trial that allows users to see the features that make your company stand out from the competition.<\/p>\n<h3>Email Marketing<\/h3>\n<p>In terms of nurturing, I\u2019d recommend taking advantage of email marketing. This marketing tactic is attractive to consumers when companies send a personalized \u201cthank you\u201d email, be it for registering for an upcoming webinar or for merely signing up to your newsletter.<\/p>\n<p>Email marketing is also cost-effective. It allows you to foster engagement with leads while still planting seeds for a sale. This direct communication between you and the lead is also a considerable advantage.<\/p>\n<p>Investigating marketing automation is a worthwhile step, too, especially in specifically timed email campaigns. Mailchimp is a common choice, and it could be a great fit for your company\u2019s marketing plan (and its marketing budget).<\/p>\n<h2>Be Consistent<\/h2>\n<p>If there\u2019s one takeaway you remember from our SaaS marketing guide, it\u2019s that consistency is vital. As a brand, you need to be consistent in all aspects \u2014 your messaging, content, visuals, timing, social media, and product.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re having trouble with consistency, potential marketing tools like an editorial calendar or a social media posting schedule can help you stay on track with your content marketing strategy.<\/p>\n<h2>Final Thoughts<\/h2>\n<p>Although the scope of SaaS marketing work is extensive, it\u2019s certainly worth the effort you put in primarily through research. The market and its consumers are always evolving, and SaaS marketing is a great way to stay on top of that constant change.<\/p>\n<p>The best thing you can do for your company is to take a long, hard look at what you\u2019d like to achieve through SaaS marketing and go from there. In simpler terms, SaaS marketing is what you make it. Your marketing efforts will determine your success.<\/p>\n<p>But in terms of marketing success, the world is your oyster.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most SaaS Companies Struggle with Generating New Business...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many SaaS businesses grow strategically.
