But what exactly is enterprise SEO? In simple terms, we usually talk of enterprise SEO when it comes to the application of the fundamental search engine optimization (SEO) best practices to big websites. Usually, these are websites for large companies. It is important to mention that enterprise SEO is not fundamentally different from general <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO<\/a>. The main differences usually have to do with the scale, strategy, and execution. As with any marketing strategy, it is often best to try to sync messaging and the overall goals across all your marketing channels (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/social-media-marketing\/\">social media<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/ppc-management\/\">ppc<\/a>, etc.) Below is a discussion about what enterprise level SEO entails and the strategies that organizations can count on to enhance and maintain their ranking.<\/p>\n<p>There is no standard definition of enterprise SEO. But generally, an enterprise usually means a large business, while SEO can be understood as the process of improving a website&#8217;s ranking on major search engines, such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo. Therefore, enterprise SEO can be understood as the process of enhancing the organic search ranking of websites belonging to large organizations. Below is a road map that you can follow to ensure that your enterprise website performs better in search.<\/p>\n<h2>Make it Easy for Google To Find Your Website<\/h2>\n<p>Before you can start thinking about search ranking, you should first worry about whether your website is going to be found by Google for indexing. Google usually does this through a process known as crawling. It starts off the process with a known page. It then finds links on this page and follows these links to discover other pages. This happens even for an enterprise website. Google will start from one of the website\u2019s pages, where it finds internal links to discover other pages of the website. Therefore, if you create a page on your website and then fail to add links from elsewhere on your website, you are making it more difficult for Google to know that page exists.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14259\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/internal-linking.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"728\" height=\"298\" \/><\/p>\n<p>The implication of this is that you have to be smart about how you structure your enterprise website. For instance, for you to make it easier for Google to find your website&#8217;s pages, your website&#8217;s internal linking structure should be set up in a logical manner. In professional SEO terms, you should set up a hub which should then be linked to subpages, also known as spokes. This will give you what SEO professionals call a topic cluster. The process may sound complex to you, but it actually makes it easier for crawlers to understand the structure of your website and consequently find your web pages easily.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Enterprise Businesses Need Customized Solutions...That's All We Do!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many enterprise businesses grow strategically. Let us do it for you!<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>Make Use of Backlinks<\/h2>\n<p>Recent studies have found that only about 9 percent of website pages get organic search traffic. This means that over 90 percent of website pages are invisible. So why is it the case? Experts suggest that this has to do with the absence of backlinks. Indeed, over 55 percent of these web pages do not have enough quality backlinks. This is quite surprising given the fact that there is a clear correlation between the use of backlinks and organic search traffic. Although there are many different <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/link-building\/\">link building<\/a> strategies, there are two that are more common. The first one involves getting other authors who have mentioned your business name on other websites and requesting them to link the mention to your website. You can find unlinked mentions by simply searching your brand name on Google and ignoring the search results from your own website&#8217;s domain. Alternatively, you can look for authors who have written on similar topics as you and send them emails requesting them to link your content. To this end, you should make the email personalized, short, and respectful. You should also make it clear on how linking their content to yours can be beneficial to them too.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-14261\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/LinkBuilding.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"890\" height=\"466\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/LinkBuilding.png 1470w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/LinkBuilding-770x403.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/LinkBuilding-765x400.png 765w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/LinkBuilding-768x402.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Target Topics That Have a Huge Traffic Potential<\/h2>\n<p>Even with backlinks, some pages still go not get any search traffic at all. This can be explained by the fact they do not cover topics or do content creation with significant traffic potential. To make this simple for you, you cannot get traffic to your website if you are publishing pages with topics or keywords that people are not interested in. So how can you know what internet users are looking for? For you to get an answer to this question, it is wise for you to do thorough keyword research. Keyword research simply has to do with finding the most common phrases or words that potential customers use to search your business or services using the major search engines. There are many keyword research tools that you can use to this end. Once you have found the keywords, remember to only use those that are relevant to your business or area of specialization. You will have to avoid using the keywords with low search volume and those that are more difficult to rank.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-14263\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/keyword-research.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"732\" height=\"461\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/keyword-research.png 1200w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/keyword-research-770x484.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/keyword-research-636x400.png 636w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/keyword-research-768x483.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Content is Still the King<\/h2>\n<p>As with general SEO, the importance of high-quality content cannot be overemphasized when it comes to enterprise SEO. This is because search engines love fresh content and they will index and rank your pages quickly when you regularly update your website with new and relevant content. However, the truth is that great content does not create itself. As such, for your enterprise website to have a constant flow of fresh content, it is imperative for you to invest in content marketing teams. You will need an internal team and an external team. The in-house team will just need a few people, the most important ones being staff writers and a blog editor. The External team should be comprised of outsourced writers working under an internal editor. All in all, there is no any given formula for structuring teams, and therefore, you can choose what is you think will work for you. The important thing is to have a team that will be fully committed to delivering top-quality content for your enterprise on a regular basis.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-14265\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/content-seo.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"780\" height=\"408\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/content-seo.png 1200w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/content-seo-770x403.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/content-seo-764x400.png 764w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/content-seo-768x402.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Make Use of Featured Snippets<\/h2>\n<p>Featured snippets are quite effective in helping enterprise websites to get high-quality traffic. That is why your enterprise SEO strategy should incorporate initiatives that involve targeting as well as winning featured snippets. If your website is appearing in a featured snippet, it is going to be in the spotlight, and this will consequently reduce the chance of people visiting your competitors&#8217; website. On the other hand, excluding a featured snippet will mean giving away potential business to your competitors.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14266\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/What-is-a-featured-snippet.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"939\" height=\"499\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/What-is-a-featured-snippet.png 939w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/What-is-a-featured-snippet-770x409.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/What-is-a-featured-snippet-753x400.png 753w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/What-is-a-featured-snippet-768x408.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 939px) 100vw, 939px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Enterprise SEO Should Be an Ongoing Process<\/h2>\n<p>Search engine optimization is not a set-and-forget marketing approach. Even if your website is ranking at the top today, you have to keep in mind that your competitors are doing all that they can to overtake you. Even paid searches can potentially push your ranking downwards. Therefore, small success should never make your complacent. You have to keep doing what you have been doing and learning new trends in online marketing to remain competitive. In other words, enterprise SEO should be approached as an ongoing marketing project. As such, you should regularly monitor and measure your results and adapt your SEO approach based on the newest available data. For instance, you can make use of rank tracking tools to monitor the keywords that you are targeting and take note of even the slightest changes that should inform your next course of action.<\/p>\n<h2>The Takeaway<\/h2>\n<p>Overall, it is apparent that that enterprise SEO is not fundamentally different from general SEO. They both seek to enhance the ranking of websites on the major search engines. However, they differ in terms of scale and strategy. As such, if you are managing an enterprise website, it is wise for you to ensure that you have the necessary tools and skills to push its ranking up and maintain a good ranking. If you are not sure of what you should be doing to this end, it is wise for you to seek the assistance of an experienced enterprise SEO agency.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Enterprise Businesses Need Customized Solutions...That's All We Do!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many enterprise businesses grow strategically.
