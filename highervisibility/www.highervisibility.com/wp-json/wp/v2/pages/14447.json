Apart from the federal and state laws that cannabis businesses have to maneuver, marketing the products on social networks is often associated with restrictions. However, considering that there are over <a href=\"https:\/\/www.statista.com\/topics\/3196\/social-media-usage-in-the-united-states\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">246 million<\/a> active social media users in the US, these platforms can help you achieve amazing results. Businesses that want to broaden their reach while avoiding penalties will have to be creative with their advertisements.<\/p>\n<p>Below are some cannabis social media marketing tips and strategies you can use:<\/p>\n<h2>Know your audience<\/h2>\n<p>The first thing you should do is to know your audience and identify the best way to speak directly to them. Whether you are in the CBD, Hemp, or Cannabis industry, take time to gather information regarding who your target customers are and what they are interested in. It would also be important to know the age, gender, and income level of the customers. Your research should seek to find out their level of knowledge about cannabis, their concerns about cannabis use, and where they get industry information from. These details will help you identify the right platforms and create an impactful digital marketing message.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14208\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/screenshot-www.facebook.com-2020.05.11-13_36_28.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1104\" height=\"544\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/screenshot-www.facebook.com-2020.05.11-13_36_28.png 1104w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/screenshot-www.facebook.com-2020.05.11-13_36_28-770x379.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/screenshot-www.facebook.com-2020.05.11-13_36_28-812x400.png 812w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/screenshot-www.facebook.com-2020.05.11-13_36_28-768x378.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1104px) 100vw, 1104px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Post engaging and educational content<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to social media marketing, you should not assume that all your followers are already members of the cannabis community. There are a good number of people who are new to the products and will be wary of cannabis brands. Others will have a negative attitude towards the products or have a difficult time choosing cannabis products whose qualities match their values. You can work with content writers to create educational content that will help you increase your brand authority and ensure you deliver value to your followers.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-14451 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/cannabis-education-e1592837311121.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"628\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Build a presence on multiple platforms<\/h2>\n<p>If you want to extend your brand reach, consider building a presence on multiple social media platforms. While Facebook, Instagram, and Google are some of the most popular platforms, you can also post content and ads on Twitter, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. Cannabis brands that maintain an active presence on several social media platforms will be in a better position to achieve their marketing objectives. However, you should review the terms and policies of the different social channels to avoid being banned or offending the law.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most Cannabis Businesses Struggle with Generating Sales Online...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many Cannabis businesses grow strategically. Let us do it for you!<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>Invest in images and video<\/h2>\n<p>When creating content, images are 39 percent more engaging than traditional text posts. Videos will perform even better than static images, helping you keep your audience interested in what you have to say. As such, you should consider using a combination of text, image, and video content. You can even include pictures of yourself and other employees. In addition, you should make sure that the content is shareable so that you reach more people. Other ways of hitting a larger reach include using relevant keywords, hashtags, and paid ads whenever possible.<\/p>\n<h2>Be consistent<\/h2>\n<p>Being consistent will go a long way in ensuring customers identify with and connect with your brand. Your voice and brand image should be consistent across the different social media platforms that you use. Consistency will help to build a strong brand image and increase brand awareness. Similarly, you should be consistent in the way you post content on the various social networks. A content strategy that emphasizes consistency will help you set good expectations and remain relevant for a long time.<\/p>\n<h2>Socialize<\/h2>\n<p>Although high numbers on social media can be attractive, there will be no point in having only a small percentage of your audience actually caring about your products. Rather than focusing on increasing your social media following, you should work on building a community of loyal customers. In addition to posting high-quality content, it would be important to engage your audience to build relationships with them. Starting and maintaining conversations will also be a great way to deliver customer service and get immediate feedback from customers.<\/p>\n<h2>Do not overly promote yourself<\/h2>\n<p>When using social media to promote your cannabis brand, you should strike a balance between promotional and educational content. When you include ads and salesy language in all your posts, your audience will soon grow weary of the content. Instead of focusing too much on yourself, you may want to consider sharing your insight and opinion. By letting people know what you think about different topics, you will be able to come across as an expert and connect better with your customers.<\/p>\n<h2>Partner with social media influencers<\/h2>\n<p>Working with influencers can help you make the most of these social channels. Influencers usually have a large social media following and will help you get your message to your target audience. Considering the huge social media following and influence that the individuals enjoy, influencer marketing can be a great way to achieve organic growth. Another strategy to expand your social reach is to turn your customers into brand ambassadors. When happy customers share your content and endorse your dispensary or products, they are likely to influence the purchase decisions of potential customers.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14452\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/cannabis-influencer.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/cannabis-influencer.png 1000w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/cannabis-influencer-755x500.png 755w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/cannabis-influencer-604x400.png 604w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/cannabis-influencer-768x508.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Hire a cannabis-specific marketing agency<\/h2>\n<p>Marketing cannabis on social media can be very challenging. Hiring a cannabis-specific marketing agency will make it easy to deal with the strict advertising restrictions and minimize the chances of your social media accounts getting flagged or banned. The agency you choose should test and measure your marketing strategy from time to time, and make the necessary adjustments to ensure you get great results.<\/p>\n<h2>Understand guidelines and restrictions<\/h2>\n<p>Cannabis social media marketing comes with its fair share of risks. Today, media companies are under the federal government&#8217;s microscope and will want to comply with all the applicable laws and regulations. Most of these social channels also have their own guidelines and restrictions when it comes to promoting cannabis. Before investing in social media marketing, you should familiarize yourself with the do&#8217;s and don&#8217;ts of the sites. If you want to maintain a professional image, post responsibly to avoid being consistently shut down.<\/p>\n<h2>Give your target audience a reason to visit your page<\/h2>\n<p>As much as you will want to follow the rules and tips, you should also give your followers a reason to visit your store and purchase your products. Make sure you offer loyalty rewards, deals, and referral incentives, so your followers are encouraged to interact with your page. This will go a long way in improving your sales performance.<\/p>\n<p>Social media is a powerful marketing tool that marijuana businesses can use to overcome marketing challenges and increase their customer base. However, with the serious impact that advertising on social platforms can have on your brand image and business, you should work with an experienced social media agency.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most Cannabis Businesses Struggle with Generating Sales Online...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many Cannabis businesses grow strategically.
