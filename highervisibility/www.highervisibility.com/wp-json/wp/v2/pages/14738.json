Like with any other industry, the goal of a hotel chain is to sell a service or product. And, with most other things in life, it\u2019s critical to make an excellent first impression.<\/p>\n<p>When a potential guest comes to your hotel\u2019s website, there are a number of questions they are looking to answer: Where is your hotel located? What do your rooms look like? How much is a room per night?<\/p>\n<p>Hotel web design means optimizing your site both visually and navigationally. You want to draw your reader in while delivering a smooth and organized experience that allows them to find what they need quickly and easily.<\/p>\n<p>Inspiring your guests to book with your hotel over another is about more than just covering your bases. You need to go above and beyond to capture their attention and convince them that you\u2019re the best hotel option for their needs.<\/p>\n<p>You can hit your booking goals by drawing inspiration from some of the most visually captivating hotel sites to drive web traffic and increase engagement.<\/p>\n<h2>Basic Website Elements<\/h2>\n<p>Before we get into the great examples of hotel <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/website-design\/\">website design<\/a>, let\u2019s explore features about the top websites that users like to see.<\/p>\n<h3>Easy Navigation<\/h3>\n<p>A cluttered, complicated website will drive readers away, but a structured, organized platform is appealing and user-friendly. By arranging your site\u2019s pages in a clear and smart way, you can ensure a stress-free experience that will lead your readers right where they need to go.<\/p>\n<p>A site visitor shouldn\u2019t have to work hard to <a href=\"https:\/\/smallbiztrends.com\/2019\/01\/easy-website-navigation-is-important.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">navigate through a website<\/a>. The fact of that matter is that the website was made specifically for them: the consumer. You may like the way you\u2019ve set up your site, but if the organization isn\u2019t there, your opinion doesn\u2019t really matter.<\/p>\n<p>Fancy animations, tons of drop-down menus, and hidden toolbars might look kind of cool, but they make it harder for visitors to find what they\u2019re looking for.<\/p>\n<p>Furthermore, a well-structured website can actually boost your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO<\/a>. It lets search engines like Google better identify and index your site so people can search and find your hotel and the packages you offer.<\/p>\n<h3>Good Speeds<\/h3>\n<p>Nothing is more frustrating than clicking on a website that takes forever to load. Speed goes beyond quality internet providers, and there are actually things you can do to make sure your website is as fast as possible.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if you have <a href=\"https:\/\/moz.com\/learn\/seo\/page-speed\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">optimized images<\/a>, your website will load faster.<\/p>\n<p>Obtaining good speeds for your website has to do with a lot of different factors, such as the widgets, images, and add-ons you use and the website builder you\u2019ve chosen. Other things, like videos that play automatically or a built-in live chat feature, can impact your speeds.<\/p>\n<p>Users are smart; if they click a website that isn\u2019t loading correctly or quickly, they will simply hit the \u2018back\u2019 button and try a different site.<\/p>\n<h3>Quality Content and Readability<\/h3>\n<p>People love to scan articles. And on top of that, most successful websites have a readability level at about 8th or 9th grade.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say that your customer base isn\u2019t intelligent enough to read at a higher level &#8211; that\u2019s just not what they\u2019re here for. They can cozy up with a novel during their free time, but right now, they want to get information as quickly and efficiently as possible.<\/p>\n<p>Quality content is original, readable, well-organized, and to the point. And in order to improve scannability, it\u2019s best to write in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.intechnic.com\/blog\/best-practices-to-improve-text-readability-for-optimal-user-experience\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">short sentences with small paragraphs<\/a>. Stick to three to five lines per paragraph. Also, try to include one main idea for each topic. Outline your pages with subheadings to break up the content.<\/p>\n<p>Your content is also where you can include keywords for SEO. Some websites like to completely flood their pages with keywords; however, that\u2019s not actually the best way to get recognized by search engines.<\/p>\n<p>Include keywords, but don\u2019t overdo it. Three to five main keywords per page is sufficient, with secondary keywords appearing only once or twice.<\/p>\n<p>Essential information like room sizes, availability, and pricing shouldn\u2019t be hidden deep in an article several clicks into the website. Make sure this information is readily available and easy to find.<\/p>\n<h3>Images and Videos<\/h3>\n<p>In a time crunch, a website user is much more likely to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.wordstream.com\/blog\/ws\/2017\/03\/08\/video-marketing-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">watch a quick video<\/a> for answers than to read a full article. Likewise, pictures can make or break their experience.<\/p>\n<p>Since most people judge a new website based on appearance first, high-quality pictures and videos are an excellent way to boost your appeal.<\/p>\n<p>No one wants to book a hotel without seeing it first. Explicit photos of rooms, the facility, and the property are the best way to entice and inspire potential guests. Use photos to show off anything that sets your hotel apart, like a beautiful oceanfront view or an outdoor pool and spa.<\/p>\n<p>Scrolling pictures right on the landing page are perfect for capturing the attention of your site visitors. They can immediately see what your hotel looks like and decide if they\u2019re interested before browsing the rest of your site.<\/p>\n<h3>Call to Action<\/h3>\n<p>A hotel website host should do everything in their power to secure a booking from a site visitor. One of the best ways to accomplish this is to have a constant call to action with a booking link.<\/p>\n<p>Your design might be beautiful and captivating, but if it\u2019s not made clear where a client can book, they can easily become frustrated or discouraged from choosing your hotel. Use a simple and clear \u2018book now\u2019 button to let guests know exactly where to click.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most Hotels Struggle with Generating Bookings Online...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many Hotels grow strategically.

Elivi Hotels employs the latter, with a touch of the former.<\/p>\n<p>The site opens up to a dynamic sky-high image looking over the Greecian island and the resort. The color scheme draws from the natural colors presented in this image and uses them throughout the site, giving it a unified and pleasant appearance.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, you immediately see the call to action located at the top right corner in bold letters. As you scroll down, you\u2019re presented with soft images in the pale and pretty color scheme. Right away, you can find a link for the resort\u2019s accommodations, which is highly convenient.<\/p>\n<p>Just beyond that, there\u2019s actually an availability checker that allows you to input basic information such as desired dates and number of guests. This feature is useful because potential customers can check their dates before dreaming through the rest of the site.<\/p>\n<p>A minor yet noticeable feature that this website has is a customized mouse icon. It\u2019s a small detail, but it does add to the overall design and gives the site a unique touch.<\/p>\n<h2>It\u2019s All About Design<\/h2>\n<p>Nowadays, if your hotel doesn\u2019t have a website, you\u2019re essentially out of the game. Online booking is the most prevalent way to plan a vacation and secure a spot in a resort. Very few people want to plan a luxurious vacation without actually seeing the place in which they are staying.<\/p>\n<p>Use the examples above to compile thoughts, ideas, and inspiration for your hotel web design. Remember: first impressions are everything, and the user experience should be simple, easy, and quick.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most Hotels Struggle with Generating Bookings Online...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many Hotels grow strategically.
