Statistics show that 63% of your customers will visit your site whenever they need to contact you to hire your services. It is how the online world operates. To avoid disappointing potential new business, look for top web designers to build a quality contractor website for you.<\/p>\n<h2>Why is Contractor Website Design Crucial?<\/h2>\n<p>Some of the most prominent business owners owe their success to their websites. As mentioned earlier, a great site makes it much easier for potential customers to reach out to you, but that is not all. It is also excellent for digital marketing because there is no place better to advertise or market your small business than your own customized website.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14374\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/responsive-websites-transparent_final2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1080\" height=\"550\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/responsive-websites-transparent_final2.png 1080w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/responsive-websites-transparent_final2-770x392.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/responsive-websites-transparent_final2-785x400.png 785w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/responsive-websites-transparent_final2-768x391.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Besides, the first place a potential customer will go to learn more about your company is to your website. No one wants to hire you if they do not know a single thing about you, your years of experience, or how your previous clients rate your services (testimonials).<\/p>\n<p>An effective construction company website will help you smash your different business goals and get ahead of your many competitors.

Let us do it for you!<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h2>Website Content Creation<\/h2>\n<p>Your contractor website might be new or old, but either way, it will need content. Think about hiring experienced copywriters who can create it for you. They should be well-versed with search engine optimization (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO<\/a>) because unless your website is optimized, your company will not appear on clients&#8217; Google search results. This means that you will have fewer traffic and customers, and you might not make the high profit you were hoping for.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14375\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-glazerconstruction.com-2020.06.18-14_11_35.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1701\" height=\"1287\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-glazerconstruction.com-2020.06.18-14_11_35.png 1701w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-glazerconstruction.com-2020.06.18-14_11_35-661x500.png 661w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-glazerconstruction.com-2020.06.18-14_11_35-529x400.png 529w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-glazerconstruction.com-2020.06.18-14_11_35-370x280.png 370w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-glazerconstruction.com-2020.06.18-14_11_35-768x581.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-glazerconstruction.com-2020.06.18-14_11_35-1536x1162.png 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1701px) 100vw, 1701px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Bear in mind that there are different SEO techniques that you can use when optimizing your site. For instance, the premium professional web design company you hire can rewrite your current content, incorporating all the top keywords in your industry. The experts can also add subtitles, acquire backlinks and citations as well as encourage previous clients to leave genuine positive reviews.<\/p>\n<p>Do not settle for anything but premium content for your site. Remember that it is a reflection of your home remodeling company. Vet your copywriters before they start working for you. You can also hire editors to ensure that the content is perfect.<\/p>\n<h2>Quality Landing Page Design<\/h2>\n<p>Landing pages are incredibly important for your contractor website. You do not necessarily need one. You can have several of them as long as they are well optimized and relevant to your business. With a great landing page, you can get more traffic, rank better in search engines, and even grow your brand.<\/p>\n<p>For a landing page to convert, it has to be good. Even though your goal is to promote your business, do not do that on landing pages. Instead, focus on what you are offering your clients while tying the content to your brand. Address your particular audience and let them know why they should go through with the registration process.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14370\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/contractor-landing-page.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"427\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/contractor-landing-page.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/contractor-landing-page-770x321.jpg 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/contractor-landing-page-959x400.jpg 959w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/contractor-landing-page-768x320.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Ask the experts you hired for your contractor web design project to ensure that the forms are not lengthy. They might scare away visitors. Instead, request them to create short forms. They can also break them into several steps so that your customers can see their progress with every part they complete.<\/p>\n<p>You can also thank your visitors on your landing page and include a call-to-action such as a phone number or contact information.<\/p>\n<h2>Mobile-Friendly Contractor Websites<\/h2>\n<p>A mobile-friendly website translates into a great user experience, which is precisely what your customers need. According to research, 57% of online users use their tablets and smartphones to access websites. When your contractor website designers create your website to be mobile-friendly, you will get more traffic, which is good for your home improvement company.<\/p>\n<p>When you create that effective web design job post, make it clear that the right candidate should know everything about creating a mobile-friendly contractor website. They should be able to use a responsive design on the content management system (CMS) they choose, depending on that which is best for your business. Other things that they can do to build your website include using simple designs, optimizing the size of the images posted, using standard fonts, and enabling the &#8220;submit&#8221; button.<\/p>\n<p>A great designer should also have experience with frameworks such as Bootstrap to ensure that users have a great experience when navigating the site using their mobile devices.<\/p>\n<h2>Call and Lead Tracking<\/h2>\n<p>Lead tracking is critical because it allows you to measure the success of your digital marketing campaigns. Through it, you can know how many potential customers have visited your construction business website and the latter&#8217;s overall performance. If you dislike the results you get after tracking your leads; you can make a few changes to enhance your conversation rate and achieve better results.<\/p>\n<p>Make sure your construction industry website design professionals install Google Analytics on the website they build for you. It is highly efficient when it comes to lead tracking.<\/p>\n<p>With call tracking, you can know how many calls you receive from your website within a specific period, mostly a month. Call tracking data helps you to know whether your marketing campaigns are successful or not. Your web designers should install a reliable and quality call tracking software on your site so that the call tracking process goes smoothly.<\/p>\n<p>Do not underestimate the importance of quality contractor website design services. They can enable you to appear at the top of search engine results pages (SERP), generate more leads, and even offer a better user experience. With them, it is unbelievably easy for your home improvement or construction business to grow. When hiring web designers, ensure that they are qualified. You do not want to place the future of your company in the wrong hands.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most Contractors Struggle with Generating New Clients...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many contractors grow strategically.
