If your website is optimized for engagement and lead generation, it presents a golden opportunity to engage visitors and convert them to leads, which is valuable for any growth-focused business. There are many marketing strategies to optimize your site for lead generation;<\/p>\n<p><i>User Experience Design<\/i> &#8211; It&#8217;s your responsibility to make the website easy for visitors to navigate and find what they need. Some of the key usability features of a high-performance lead generation website include responsive <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/website-design\/\">web design<\/a>, fast-loading web pages, site architecture, image loading techniques, etc.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-14374\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/responsive-websites-transparent_final2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"605\" height=\"308\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/responsive-websites-transparent_final2.png 1080w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/responsive-websites-transparent_final2-770x392.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/responsive-websites-transparent_final2-785x400.png 785w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/responsive-websites-transparent_final2-768x391.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 605px) 100vw, 605px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><i>Content Marketing<\/i> &#8211; Content marketing involves creating and distributing educational content to build trust and authority around your business.

Setting up a Google Maps listing targets more customers in your immediate area. Make sure you display your contact details (Business name, telephone number, address) boldly. Additionally, try and get as many reviews as possible as this is the best place to get the most out of customer reviews. Other listings include Yelp, Search Your Business, Homestars, etc.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter wp-image-14361\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.06.18-13_14_51.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"558\" height=\"893\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.06.18-13_14_51.png 975w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.06.18-13_14_51-313x500.png 313w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.06.18-13_14_51-250x400.png 250w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.06.18-13_14_51-768x1229.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.06.18-13_14_51-960x1536.png 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Social Media Marketing<\/h3>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/social-media-marketing\/\">Social media<\/a> does dominate our modern society. Consumers expect all construction businesses to have a Facebook business page at least. You, therefore, cannot underestimate the power of leveraging social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn or Instagram to engage with your audience and generate leads.<\/p>\n<p>Use your social media channels to present new products, offers, respond to customers concerns and demonstrate your active status in the industry. Further, join social media groups where your local community members engage and get your name out.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14352\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Facebook-contractor.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"515\" height=\"541\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Facebook-contractor.png 515w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Facebook-contractor-476x500.png 476w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Facebook-contractor-381x400.png 381w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Email Campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>No modern lead generation strategy is complete without email marketing. To get more sign-ups and grow your email list, consider incentivizing the audience you&#8217;re trying to attract. An effective way to do this is to offer things like white papers, ebooks, and homeowners&#8217; guides in exchange for a sign-up. Once they subscribe, continue to send more valuable content or offers and remember to add a bit of personalization to your emails as it can really boost open rates.<\/p>\n<h3>Word of Mouth (Referrals)<\/h3>\n<p>The home service field is a small world, especially if limited to a particular region. You want to ensure you&#8217;re part of a circle of businesses being recommended to potential clients as these are typically the highest quality leads. If you are not receiving as many referrals as you should, find out why. Possible reasons could be;<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You&#8217;re charging too much<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your customers aren&#8217;t happy with the services they are receiving<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don&#8217;t ask for referrals<\/li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You don&#8217;t keep in touch with past clients \u2013 Staying top of mind results in better referral leads generation.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most Contractors Struggle with Generating New Clients...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many contractors grow strategically.

They are most preferable for those times when you need work immediately and don&#8217;t have time to sit around waiting. When used in conjunction with your passive lead generation techniques, they can allow you to fill any gaps and make up for any weaknesses your other strategies may have.<\/p>\n<h3>Pay-Per-Click Advertising<\/h3>\n<p>A properly executed <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/ppc-management\/\">PPC<\/a> campaign can deliver immediate results and feedback. As the name suggests, you pay for every click a prospect makes on your advert, regardless of whether they close a deal. It&#8217;s a great way to kick off your marketing campaign or boost your reach every now and then. Consider hiring a lead gen company to improve your conversions.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14368\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.06.18-13_33_52.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"920\" height=\"565\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.06.18-13_33_52.png 920w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.06.18-13_33_52-770x473.png 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.06.18-13_33_52-651x400.png 651w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.06.18-13_33_52-768x472.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 920px) 100vw, 920px\" \/><\/p>\n<h3>Buying Leads From Lead Resellers like Homeadvisor, Angie&#8217;s List and Thumbtack<\/h3>\n<p>These lead generation services\/sites attract consumers to their platforms, where the prospects submit project details. They then verify the new leads and sell them to contractors.<\/p>\n<p>If you are new to sales or just trying to get a better understanding of the whole lead generation process, then it&#8217;s crucial to learn and get a grip of your sales process. A common challenge for many contractors is the inability to generate enough leads or generating leads that aren&#8217;t of good quality. If you are out there and are stuck with a lack of new opportunities or have a bunch of opportunities that don&#8217;t ever pan out, then the problem could actually lie in your sales process. How do you try and turn opportunities into paying customers? By having a consistent way of proceeding to a sale. Small things like calling prospects back immediately or clearly communicating and guiding on relevant subjects and following up can make a significant difference. If you do it right, everybody wins.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re struggling to get new contractor leads or are unsure of how to market your services online, we can help grow your business.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most Contractors Struggle with Generating New Clients...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many contractors grow strategically.
