They have to balance between managing the expectations of their clients and generating enough business to remain afloat. Therefore, the importance of lead gen marketing strategy to law firms cannot be overemphasized. However, most lawyers work long hours, and therefore, worrying about marketing usually does not rank high on their to-do-list. As such, lawyers need to come up with ways of getting their lead generation system running on &#8220;autopilot&#8221; mode so that they can have all the time that they need to focus on what they do best. Below are some of the tips that you can count on to get your law practice more quality leads.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-14171\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/lead-gen-lawyers.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1000\" height=\"410\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/lead-gen-lawyers.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/lead-gen-lawyers-770x316.jpg 770w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/lead-gen-lawyers-976x400.jpg 976w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/lead-gen-lawyers-768x315.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Invest in Professional Web Design<\/h2>\n<p>The first step that you have to take in the bid to fetch more leads for your law firm has to do with creating a website. However, having a website is not enough. In any case, almost all your competitors have websites. Therefore, you have to invest in professional <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/website-design\/\">web design<\/a> for you to stand out. Such a web design will inspire confidence and encourage prospective clients to contact your law firm and even hire you. For instance, your home page and landing pages should be organized in such a way that your visitors can easily find what they are looking for on your website without getting overwhelmed. Besides, your website should be easy to navigate in addition to being fast in order to optimize the user experience. Furthermore, it should have multiple calls to action and a contact form that doesn&#8217;t take a lot of your visitors&#8217; time to fill. All these design features will go a long way in encouraging people landing on your website through paid and organic searches to contact you when they need the services of a lawyer.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14201\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/screenshot-www.brashierlaw.com-2020.05.11-13_18_19-e1589221349446.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"793\" height=\"600\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Invest in Search Engine Optimization (SEO)<\/h2>\n<p>Search engine optimization is a marketing technique that seeks to improve the ranking of your website on major search engines, such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo. A successful <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO<\/a> campaign should ensure that your website appears on the first page of search results when people search for keywords that are associated with your services. For instance, if you are a personal injury lawyer operating in New York City, people searching &#8220;the best personal injury attorney in New York&#8221; should see your website on the first page of their search results.<\/p>\n<p>There are several things that you should do on this end. For instance, you must always ensure that you constantly post fresh content on your website. The content must be useful to both your visitors and the search engines. You can do this by posting blog posts regularly. You should also target specialized keywords and make use of them wisely. For instance, you can target keywords that are location-specific and related to your specific area of specialization. Last but not least, you must focus on link building. To be specific, getting links from top domain and heavily trafficked websites can go a long way in boosting your website&#8217;s ranking.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most Law Firms Struggle with Generating New Clients...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many lawyers grow their practice.

Unlike SEO marketing, which may take up to several years to bear fruitful results, this advertising technique can start helping you to get leads almost immediately. As with the SEO strategy, you have to conduct thorough keyword research for you to determine the most appropriate keywords for you to target. However, you have remembered that PPC can be quite expensive especially for law firm-related keywords. Therefore, you should remember to refine your geo-targeting settings. To put this into perspective, if people clicking your paid ad will have to travel further than they need to just to get to your office, then you will certainly be losing money.<img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-14205\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/05\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.05.11-13_26_26-e1589221660971.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"609\" height=\"700\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>Invest In High-Quality Content<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to online marketing, content is the king. Without high-quality content, your website will be of no value to people landing on it by whichever means. Therefore, it is wise for you to start investing in high-quality content. To this end, you should ensure that all content posted on your website is not only unique but also informative. While encouraging people to seek the services of a lawyer should be a part of it, you should avoid sounding salesy in your blog posts and videos. For you to make the information you provide through this content credible, you should ensure that you link it to reliable sources, where necessary. By constantly creating superlative content, you will gradually establish yourself as an authority in your area of practice, and this will consequently help you to gain the trust of potential clients landing on your website. Furthermore, high-quality content will also enable you to improve your website&#8217;s Google ranking and consequently help you to get more leads from organic searches.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most Law Firms Struggle with Generating New Clients...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many lawyers grow their practice.

Therefore, in addition to ensuring that your online presence is a well-established online presence, you also have to be good at what you do to sustainably continue getting business. Therefore, you should dedicate yourself to providing quality services and ensuring that the clients that you get are 100 percent satisfied. After serving them satisfactorily, you can ask them to refer other people to you. If you manage to meet and exceed your clients&#8217; expectations, then they are likely going to tell other people about you and consequently bring more leads to your law firm.<\/p>\n<h2>Make it Easy for Potential Clients To Contact You<\/h2>\n<p>The end goal of your advertising campaign is to get more people calling you for consultation.

To this end, you should invest in 24\/7 call answering services and make use of call extensions. For you to make it even easier for prospective clients to reach your law firm, you should also have an online chat system where they can get their inquiries addressed instantly.

If you are not sure of what could be going wrong or where you should start to this end, then it is wise for you to seek the services of a professional marketer who has experience in the legal industry.
