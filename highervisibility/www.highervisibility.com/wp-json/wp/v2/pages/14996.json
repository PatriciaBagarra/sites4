Just as a person\u2019s face is the first thing we notice when meeting someone new, your website is the first thing potential clients notice about you and your practice. Search engine optimization, or SEO, is one of the most reliable ways to ensure prospective patients find your website.<\/p>\n<p>Most people looking for a plastic surgeon will begin their search online, making local SEO of critical importance. In the digital marketing age, taking out an ad in the local Yellow Pages isn\u2019t enough. Between 71% and 92% of people don\u2019t go beyond the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/forbesagencycouncil\/2017\/10\/30\/the-value-of-search-results-rankings\/#29802de644d3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">first page<\/a> of Google search results when conducting research online.<\/p>\n<p>If you don\u2019t rank high on Google, Bing, or other search engines, most people searching for your business will never see your page. A sound SEO strategy is key to ensuring the people looking for plastic surgeons find your business. There are many reasons for investing in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO services<\/a>; here are a few:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Increased visibility on search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo<\/li>\n<li>Attract new patients to your practice<\/li>\n<li>Increased traffic to your website through local SEO<\/li>\n<li>Stay one step ahead of your competitors<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Plastic surgery SEO is just as critical as all SEO. The goal is to guide traffic to your website, thereby increasing your business. You want to make it easy for your clients to find you, and a top-notch SEO strategy can make this happen. This article will explain the tricks of the SEO trade and examine the best practices for attracting clients to your practice.<\/p>\n<h2>Why SEO for Plastic Surgeons?<\/h2>\n<p>Plastic surgery (or cosmetic surgery) is a medical specialty dedicated to reconstructing facial and body defects to return normal function and appearance to the body. Plastic surgery is in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bbc.com\/worklife\/article\/20200909-why-plastic-surgery-demand-is-booming-amid-lockdown\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">high demand<\/a>. From burn victims to cancer survivors, or those simply wanting to enhance their appearance, countless people conduct searches for plastic surgeons daily.<\/p>\n<p>With all of the interest in plastic surgery, one would think attracting clients would be easy. As a practicing plastic surgeon, you know that is not always the case. Referrals from satisfied clients and other medical professionals are certainly a boon to your business.<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever thought about the untapped potential client base who won\u2019t find your plastic surgery practice based on referrals?<\/p>\n<p>Many potential clients won\u2019t find your plastic surgery practice through referrals. Instead, the source of their referral will be Google, Bing, or another search engine. They will enter the search term \u201cplastic surgery\u201d or \u201cplastic surgeon\u201d and wait for the results to appear. Most will proceed to scroll through the search results in order, starting at the top. This leads to the question, &#8220;how can I get new patients to google my business?&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>This is where SEO comes in. The goal of SEO for plastic surgeons is to get your cosmetic surgery practice to the top of the search engine ranking, ensuring your business has the greatest exposure possible. Whenever someone enters a term into Google or another search engine, they evaluate the millions of webpages on the web and return the \u201cbest\u201d result.<\/p>\n<p>Without an effective SEO strategy, your business will not rank among the top results when people search for plastic surgeons. Since most people do not search past the first page of search engine results, it is unlikely your website will get many clicks. Refining your SEO strategy will ensure you get those clicks. Next, you will want to convert the clicks into clients.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>MOST PLASTIC SURGEONS STRUGGLE WITH GETTING PATIENTS...WE FIX THAT!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many Plastic Surgeons grow strategically.
