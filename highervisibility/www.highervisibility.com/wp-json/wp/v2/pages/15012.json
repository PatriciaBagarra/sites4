Your ads will appear in the search engine\u2019s sponsored search results section, right at the top of the page.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/ppc-management\/\">PPC<\/a> is fantastic when done correctly because it makes your practice\u2019s website more visible to potential patients. However, plastic surgeons should manage their PPC strategy closely to increase its value.<\/p>\n<p>PPC is part of a broader online marketing strategy called Search Engine Marketing (SEM), which also includes Search Engine Optimization (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO<\/a>). Using a combination of the two can increase traffic to your plastic surgery website and ensure you reach as many prospective patients as possible.<\/p>\n<h2>What is PPC?<\/h2>\n<p>This internet marketing advertising system only charges you when a potential patient clicks on your ad. After creating an ad, there will be an online auction where you\u2019ll bid on specific search phrases.<\/p>\n<p>When a patient clicks on your website link, you\u2019ll pay a small fee. Because your website is at the top of the search results, patients will be more likely to see it.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-15015\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.12.04-13_11_19-587x400.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"587\" height=\"400\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.12.04-13_11_19-587x400.png 587w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.12.04-13_11_19-734x500.png 734w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.12.04-13_11_19-768x523.png 768w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/screenshot-www.google.com-2020.12.04-13_11_19.png 885w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>There are multiple types of PPC, including:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local search ads<\/li>\n<li>Search ads<\/li>\n<li>Remarketing<\/li>\n<li>Display ads<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Although Google is the most popular search engine, Bing, Yahoo Search Marketing, and Facebook all offer PPC Advertising. Regardless of the search engine or type of ad, your post will usually look similar to other, non-paid, posts, but will appear higher in the results list. The only difference is that most platforms will label a PPC post as \u201csponsored\u201d or \u201cpromoted.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A relatively new feature in Google Ads allows you to use PPC with Google Maps to reach local patients.<\/p>\n<p>Often, practices must choose between Facebook Ads and Google Ads due to budget constraints. Although Facebook Ads allow you to collect more information about your potential patients\u2019 habits, for most medical practices, Google Ads will reach more patients at a lower cost.<\/p>\n<p>Forbes looked a gym\u2019s numbers, revealing that Facebook Ads earned 103 memberships with 150,000 impressions, but costing $11 per conversion.<\/p>\n<p>Google Ads was <a href=\"https:\/\/www.forbes.com\/sites\/theyec\/2020\/09\/01\/google-ads-vs-facebook-ads-which-platform-offers-the-best-roi\/#4e67bca83bea\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">more successful<\/a>, gaining 200 memberships at only $4 per conversion.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>MOST PLASTIC SURGEONS STRUGGLE WITH GETTING PATIENTS...WE FIX THAT!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many Plastic Surgeons grow strategically.

All major search engines use an automatic process to determine the relevance of keywords. You\u2019ll need to bid on relevant search terms or keywords at the auction for your practice.<\/p>\n<p>A plastic surgery practice in Denver specializing in rhinoplasty might bid $5 on \u201crhinoplasty Denver.\u201d The higher your bid, the higher your ad will appear in the Search Engine Result Pages (SERP). Other factors that can influence your SERP include the quality score and ad extensions.<\/p>\n<p>There are several methods to find the best keywords. You can use keyword search tools or save time and energy by working with a digital marketing agency like HigherVisibility.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve chosen your keywords correctly, your website will appear when a prospective patient searches \u201crhinoplasty Denver.\u201d Every time a prospective patient clicks on your page, you\u2019ll pay $5.<\/p>\n<p>If you budget $100 per day, you\u2019ll get about 20 clicks on a high-volume day. Over a month, you\u2019ll be paying $3,000 for 600 clicks. The goal is to turn those clicks, or potential patients, into paying customers.<\/p>\n<h2>Using Google Ads Effectively<\/h2>\n<p>Although Bing and Facebook are growing in popularity, <a href=\"https:\/\/ads.google.com\/intl\/en_us\/home\/how-it-works\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google Ads<\/a> is still the most popular PPC tool. In only a few steps, you\u2019ll have a live ad promoting your business. Google Ads also allows for setting budget caps, meaning you\u2019ll never go over budget.<\/p>\n<p>To set up your first Google Ads, you\u2019ll need first to set up an account. Once you\u2019ve done that, you\u2019ll need to:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Set a goal<\/b>. Do you want more calls from interested patients or more walk-ins? Or is your main focus attracting patient traffic to your website?<\/li>\n<li><b>Choose your location<\/b>. Is your plastic surgery practice primarily for local patients, or do you want to attract people from across the state or country?<\/li>\n<li><b>Design your ad<\/b>. In 3 short sentences, describe the heart of your plastic surgery practice. What\u2019s your motto? You can also include images to pump your ad and make it more attractive to patients.<\/li>\n<li><b>Set a budget cap<\/b>. Decide how much you\u2019re willing to pay for PPC per month. Google will show you the estimated clickthrough numbers for your chosen budget. Just remember to check back at the end of the month to see if the estimates matched the actual numbers.<\/li>\n<li><b>Choose your keywords. <\/b>Using a keyword search tool, you\u2019ll bid on specific keywords.<\/li>\n<li><b>Go live. <\/b>Once you\u2019re ready, your ads will start appearing on Google search, Google Maps, and other affiliated sites. When a patient clicks through to your website or get directions to your practice, you\u2019ll pay your predetermined bid.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3>Google Ad Campaigns<\/h3>\n<p>You can also choose to set up an <a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/google-ads\/answer\/6324971?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ad Campaign<\/a>, which is a little more complicated but allows you to manage multiple keywords, ad groups, and ads. To set up an Ad Campaign, you\u2019ll need first to choose a campaign type. You can choose between<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><b>Search<\/b>: text-based ads in search results<\/li>\n<li><b>Discovery<\/b>: ads on online feeds<\/li>\n<li><b>Display: <\/b>picture-based ads on websites<\/li>\n<li><b>Shopping:<\/b> ads for your products on Google<\/li>\n<li><b>Video:<\/b> video-based ads on YouTube<\/li>\n<li><b>Smart:<\/b> simplified, straightforward campaign<\/li>\n<li><b>App: <\/b>app promotions using many channels<\/li>\n<li><b>Local:<\/b> using location to advertise on many channels<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>MOST PLASTIC SURGEONS STRUGGLE WITH GETTING PATIENTS...WE FIX THAT!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many Plastic Surgeons grow strategically. Let us do it for you!<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<p>Medical practices will likely want to choose from the search, discovery, local, or display campaigns.<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve chosen your campaign type, you\u2019ll need to create one or more Ad Groups. Each Ad Group can contain multiple ads. You can designate one or more keywords to an Ad Group, which will then apply to all its ads.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll also need to design your ads. Depending on the type of campaign, you\u2019ll either need images or text.<\/p>\n<p>When choosing your keywords, Google will ask you what kind of match you want to select. You can either choose between 4 types:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Broad Match Modifier (BMM)<\/li>\n<li>Broad<\/li>\n<li>Exact<\/li>\n<li>Phrase<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The type of match determines how narrow the search terms are. If you choose an exact match for \u201crhinoplasty Denver,\u201d your ad will only pop up when a patient uses that term. However, the other matches allow for misspelled searches.<\/p>\n<p>Broad searches can also result in irrelevant search results. You can choose negative keywords that you don\u2019t want to lead to your page. Often, plastic surgeons include terms like lawsuit, botched surgery, etc.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t forget to set your region for your ad campaign. Some plastic surgeons want to target their local area, while others are looking to expand or attract patients from other cities. Most practices will want to narrow it down to a few zip codes or within state lines.<\/p>\n<p>The last step in an Ad Campaign is choosing your landing page. A landing page is the first page a patient sees after clicking on an ad. It\u2019s their first impression, and if you choose correctly, it will convert a prospective patient into a paying one.<\/p>\n<p>Choose your landing page based on the ad. If someone searches for \u201crhinoplasty Denver,\u201d have your ad go to your Rhinoplasty Services page. For a \u201ccosmetic surgery Denver\u201d keyword, consider using your contact us or about us page.<\/p>\n<h2>SEO or PPC?<\/h2>\n<p>Should you use SEO or PPC to promote your practice online? Surgeons frequently ask this question while trying to budget time and money for advertising. SEO and PPC, though similar, serve different purposes.<\/p>\n<p>SEO is a technique that uses keywords and backlinking to drive search traffic organically to your website. PPC, on the other hand, is a paid service. Of course, you don&#8217;t have to just pick one or the other. Some plastic surgeons may use SEO techniques, but also employ PPC to make sure they&#8217;re getting as many clicks as possible.<\/p>\n<h2>It&#8217;s Time to Reach More Clients<\/h2>\n<p>From remarketing to local search ads, there are a lot of different ways to use PPC to your practice&#8217;s benefit. Tools like Google Ads are still one of the most effective PPC techniques around, and although the budget and the keywords might look different for every practice, you can use the tips above to bring new clients into your practice.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>MOST PLASTIC SURGEONS STRUGGLE WITH GETTING PATIENTS...WE FIX THAT!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many Plastic Surgeons grow strategically.
