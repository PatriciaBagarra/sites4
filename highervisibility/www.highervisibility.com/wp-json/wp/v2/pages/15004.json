Today, people have mixed opinions on cosmetic surgery. Due to this, collecting patient leads can be challenging.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Create a Plastic Surgery Marketing Strategy That Converts<\/h2>\n<p>Lead generation focuses on the top of the sales funnel flow chart: attracting new patients. However, there are three areas of focus when creating a successful lead generation strategy that will attract client attention and drive them to purchase.<\/p>\n<h3>Attract New Clients<\/h3>\n<p>The first step for a successful lead generation strategy is to attract new patients. There are a few ways to go about this, but the most lucrative are gaining patient leads through social media and attracting potential patients to view <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/ppc-management\/\">PPC<\/a> ads and other ad campaigns.<\/p>\n<h4>Social Media Plastic Surgery Marketing<\/h4>\n<p>Perhaps one of the best ways to garner client attention is through the ongoing use of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/social-media-marketing\/\">social media<\/a>. For cosmetic surgeons, the focus should be on sites that offer the chance to share pictures. This is because cosmetic surgery rests on its visual appeal. Social media platforms like Instagram and Facebook are a great way to share visuals and attract new clients.<\/p>\n<p>One benefit of social media and internet marketing is that there is the ability to create niche and audience targeted content. Using hashtags, keywords and creating a cohesive and visually appealing profile is a great way to attract prospective patients.<\/p>\n<p>Facebook and Instagram also include the opportunity to create video content, online events, and small ad campaigns to draw in more impressions.<\/p>\n<h4>Ad Campaigns<\/h4>\n<p>Aside from social media, curating quality ad campaigns can help boost visibility. Focusing on the ideal client and creating a targeted ad campaign is an excellent way to gain more online attention. These campaigns work great because you can lead the client to a curated landing page with its funnel. You can address client questions, include email opt-ins, offer the chance to schedule a consultation, and offer testimonials.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.smallbizgenius.net\/by-the-numbers\/advertising-statistics\/#gref\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Small Biz Genius<\/a> reported that the average person views around 1,700 banner ads per month in their social media feeds, and about 45% of this content is believed to be in visual context\u2014which happens to be the best route for cosmetic surgeons as their services focus on visual appeal.<\/p>\n<p>Creating a stunning landing page that works as a funnel all on its own can be daunting, but here at Higher Visibility, we have the expertise to create something sure to pull in potential patients for your business.<\/p>\n<p>With the right technology, you can also retarget prospects who previously viewed your landing page but left before engaging. Revising your landing page is another way to continue growing your lead generation strategy to gather more clients.<\/p>\n<h3>Engage<\/h3>\n<p>While lead generation strategies tend to focus almost exclusively on attracting attention, it&#8217;s worth noting that monitoring audience engagement is a massive indicator of marketing success. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/financesonline.com\/digital-marketing-statistics\/#:~:text=%2063%20Digital%20Marketing%20Statistics%20You%20Must%20Know%3A,3%20Social%20Media%20Marketing%20Statistics.%20Social...%20More%20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Finances Online<\/a>, 69% of the time spent on digital media is spent on social media. So it&#8217;s no wonder that social media platforms are where you should grab your audience&#8217;s attention.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to engagement, social media offers plenty of space for commentary and &#8220;likes.&#8221; A good rule of thumb is to keep up a conversation with your audience. This increases the sense of authenticity and trust between your audience and your business, which in turn results in a higher conversion rate.<\/p>\n<h3>Convert<\/h3>\n<p>The main goal for a successful lead generation is conversions. At Higher Visibility, we implement the best techniques to get your client&#8217;s attention and to drive them steadily towards conversion. Conversions often come about as call-to-actions.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>MOST PLASTIC SURGEONS STRUGGLE WITH GETTING PATIENTS...WE FIX THAT!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many Plastic Surgeons grow strategically.
