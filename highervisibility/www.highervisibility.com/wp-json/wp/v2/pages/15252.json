As an HVAC contractor, you ensure people are comfortable in their home or business, whatever the weather outside may be.<\/p>\n<p>While your services are undoubtedly valuable, getting a steady flow of clients for your HVAC business isn&#8217;t always easy. The market is competitive, and it can be tough to gain traction.<\/p>\n<p>A comprehensive HVAC marketing plan can help. With the right marketing efforts, you will boost your company&#8217;s brand and attract more engaged customers. You can also foster customer loyalty, ensuring repeat clients.<\/p>\n<h2>10 HVAC Marketing Strategy Tips<\/h2>\n<p>Follow these proven marketing strategies to get started.<\/p>\n<h3>1. Establish a Consistent Business Brand for Your HVAC Company<\/h3>\n<p>Branding is an integral part of marketing success. Your brand reflects your business ethos and customer relationship. Branding covers everything from visual style to the tone of your content. Start with the aesthetic elements.<\/p>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have a logo, that&#8217;s the first issue to address. Your logo should be clear and relevant to your HVAC business. It will appear on all of your HVAC marketing materials, from business cards to websites and signage. Choose a color scheme for your logo and match this to your website and other marketing materials.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have the visual elements of your brand established, move on to content tone. Whether you&#8217;re sharing on social media or your website, you want to have a consistent tone when communicating with customers.<\/p>\n<p>For example, do you want to come across as more professional or more friendly? A friendlier tone will use direct address, like &#8220;you,&#8221; while a more professional tone might stick to third-person pronouns.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of both visuals and content, consistency is critical. Once you&#8217;ve chosen your brand style, stick with it. You want customers to be able to remember and recognize your brand easily. The aim is to create a cohesive brand presentation that resonates with customers.<\/p>\n<p>For example, all you have to see is the golden arches to identify McDonald&#8217;s. Their brand is that strong!<\/p>\n<h3>2. Create a Stellar HVAC Website<\/h3>\n<p>Your website is a primary source of information for your current and new customers. Create a user-friendly website that is easy to navigate and contains all the information your clients need if they are interested in booking your HVAC services.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15265\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/attachment_118300352.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/attachment_118300352.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/attachment_118300352-400x400.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Keep in mind that laypeople won&#8217;t understand technical language, so make sure to explain HVAC products or services in simplified terms. Describe your services clearly. Also, define your service area. For example, do you serve residential and commercial customers? What areas do you service?<\/p>\n<p>Also, make sure your contact information is displayed on the website. A banner along the bottom of the page plus a separate contact page should suffice. You want people to know how to reach you easily if they&#8217;re going to book a service or request a price quote.<\/p>\n<p>You also want your website to be secure. Check if it displays an &#8220;https&#8221; in front of the URL. It means sensitive information passing through your website is encrypted, protecting your business and client&#8217;s data. For example, if a client fills out a contact form, they want details like their phone number or email to be kept private.<\/p>\n<h3>3. Optimize Your Website for Search Engines<\/h3>\n<p>Besides building a sleek and streamlined homepage that provides potential customers with critical information about your business, you also want to make sure your website is SEO optimized. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/blog\/what-is-seo\/\">Search engine optimization<\/a> allows you to climb the rankings in Google and Bing. It drives organic traffic to your website, helping clients find you online.<\/p>\n<p>So, if a person types &#8220;HVAC contractor Atlanta GA&#8221; into Google, a well-optimized website ensures that your page is higher on the list of search engine results pages, SERPs.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15266\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/screenshot-www.google.com-2021.01.22-14_52_04.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"1114\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/screenshot-www.google.com-2021.01.22-14_52_04.png 950w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/screenshot-www.google.com-2021.01.22-14_52_04-426x500.png 426w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/screenshot-www.google.com-2021.01.22-14_52_04-341x400.png 341w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/screenshot-www.google.com-2021.01.22-14_52_04-768x901.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 950px) 100vw, 950px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here are some essential tips for <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/search-engine-optimization\/\">SEO<\/a> optimization:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Every page should center around a primary keyword, which aligns with the page&#8217;s topic.<\/li>\n<li>Secondary keywords should support the primary keyword.<\/li>\n<li>The text should be broken up into sections using H2 and H3 headers.<\/li>\n<li>Your primary keyword should appear in the H1 header, page title, and meta description.<\/li>\n<li>You should include at least one image in .jpeg or .png format, and the file should be labeled as the primary keyword.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>For more tips on optimizing your website for search engines, Google offers a comprehensive<a href=\"https:\/\/support.google.com\/webmasters\/answer\/7451184?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"> SEO starter guide<\/a>.

Let us do it for you!<\/p>\n<\/p><div class='form-action'><a class=\"button primary large scrollto\" data-target=\"lets-talk\" href=\"#\">Schedule a Consultation<\/a><\/div><\/div>\n<h3>4. Start Gathering Reviews<\/h3>\n<p>One of the best ways to get new customers is to get references from existing customers via word-of-mouth. You can leverage that by incorporating online reviews into your HVAC digital marketing strategy. You can start by creating a business page for Google, which allows you to get Google reviews. This will also help your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/local-seo-company\/\">local SEO<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s how to do it:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>To start a Google My Business page, you need a Gmail account. You can set one up for free if you don&#8217;t already have one.<\/li>\n<li>Create your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/business\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Google My Business<\/a> listing and select the type of business.<\/li>\n<li>Input essential info like a link to your website, the business address, and images.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Additionally, consider creating a business page on service review portals like Yelp. Social media profiles can also be a valuable way to get customer feedback. For example, if you create a LinkedIn or Facebook page, people can follow it. Ask existing HVAC clients if they wouldn&#8217;t mind leaving a review for you. Handing them a card with a direct link or QR code that takes them directly to the review portal makes it easy.<\/p>\n<p>As reviews start coming in, choose some of the best and add them to your website in a dedicated &#8220;testimonials&#8221; or &#8220;see what our customers have to say&#8221; page. This helps you stand out from the competition. Just make sure to link back to the original review source so that people can verify the factualness.<\/p>\n<h3>5. Get On Social Media<\/h3>\n<p>If you don&#8217;t have any social media profiles for your business, add this to your HVAC marketing strategy to-do list. Social media is a great way to interact and engage with customers directly. This is especially useful for a local HVAC business because establishing a reputation and genuinely getting to know your customers will nurture loyalty and ensure people return to you again and again.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-15267\" src=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Moore-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"602\" height=\"602\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Moore-2.jpg 602w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Moore-2-500x500.jpg 500w, https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Moore-2-400x400.jpg 400w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 602px) 100vw, 602px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>You can establish yourself as an authority in the HVAC field by sharing useful tips your clients will truly appreciate, like how they can prepare their HVAC system for seasonal changes or what sorts of HVAC air filters are best for persons allergies or asthma. Towards this end, consider pairing your social media with a blog. You can house the blog on your website and share new posts via social media.<\/p>\n<p>You can also use social media to share news about deals or specials you are offering to the clients. You might consider implementing a customer referral program, for example. If an existing customer refers you to a new customer, they both get some discount or rebate. Again, this is a proven technique to win customer loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>Another way to foster a loyal community through social media is to offer seasonal deals. People tend to require HVAC tune-ups as the seasons change. They may need a new air filter in the spring to protect against pollen or require a furnace tune-up in the fall before chilly winter weather sets in. Use your social channels to push such seasonal offers.<\/p>\n<h3>6. Try Video-Driven HVAC Marketing<\/h3>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for material to share on social media, why not make your own smartphone videos? Video marketing is hugely popular nowadays. A whopping <a href=\"https:\/\/www.markinblog.com\/video-marketing-statistics\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">85% of all internet users<\/a> in the U.S. watch online video content monthly. Video-sharing platforms like YouTube have over two billion users, almost one-third of the total internet population. Plus, with mobile devices, people can watch anytime, anywhere.<\/p>\n<p>Again, this is a great way to share useful, actionable information with consumers, building their trust and loyalty. Videos don&#8217;t have to be complicated. Think about some of the most commonly asked questions you get from customers, and answer them in a simple interview format.<\/p>\n<p>Examples might include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How frequently do you need an HVAC tune-up?<\/li>\n<li>What does it mean when your AC makes these noises?<\/li>\n<li>How can you save on your heating bills?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>By merely answering practical questions, you are showing yourself as an authority figure. You are also giving a face to your business, literally. This makes you more trustworthy and personable. You can easily integrate videos with social media by creating your own YouTube channel. You can also post these videos on your website. This encourages people to spend more people on your site, which boosts SEO ranking.<\/p>\n<h3>7. Give Email Marketing a Go<\/h3>\n<p>If you decide to promote deals and specials with your customers, email marketing will be beneficial. You can encourage people to sign up for your email list via your website. Targeted email marketing is a great way to generate HVAC leads, and it&#8217;s extremely cost-efficient. You are delivering relevant content to your customers, increasing the likelihood of conversion (sales).<\/p>\n<p>You can use many handy tools to make email marketing efficient and easy if you&#8217;re new to the business. Tools like MailChimp and MailerLite allow you to send email marketing campaigns and manage contacts. They even offer handy premade templates, so you don&#8217;t have to stress over HTML coding to create an engaging email newsletter.<\/p>\n<p>To achieve success with email marketing, don&#8217;t overload your customers. If you send them information too regularly, they will likely get annoyed and unsubscribe. Make your contact engaging and educational.<\/p>\n<p>You can repurpose some of the content described above, like informational how-to videos and details about seasonal details. When writing your email newsletter subject lines, avoid spam trigger words like &#8220;free.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Finally, for long-term email marketing success, make sure to clean up your email lists regularly. With tools like MailerLite, you can see who opened and clicked on links in your emails. For example, unengaged people who never open an email can be removed from your mailing list.<\/p>\n<h3>8. Invest In Pay-Per-Click Advertising<\/h3>\n<p>Paid ads can further boost your online presence. Pay-per-click advertising allows you to generate leads quickly. You can run <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/ppc-management\/\">PPC<\/a> ads on various platforms, including Google and Facebook. You will get immediate exposure, allowing you to direct traffic to your website. Additionally, PPC HVAC advertising can be tailored to local needs, allowing you to geo-target people in the vicinity of your business.<\/p>\n<p>With Google Ads, paid ads appear at the top of a search results page. You can see them indicated as &#8220;ads&#8221; in Google. This is an easy way to get at the &#8220;top&#8221; of the SERPs. People will see your ad and will be more likely to click on it instead of scrolling down to view results further down the page.<\/p>\n<p>When creating PPC ads, prioritize relevant keywords. You can use tools like Google AdWords Keyword Planner to check what keywords are likely to get clicks. As you select your keywords, always keep the users intent in mind. What is your target consumer likely to be searching for? If you&#8217;re in Honolulu in August, people aren&#8217;t searching for heating-related topics. If anything, they are searching for air conditioning topics.<\/p>\n<h3>9. Cross-Pollinate Your Content Marketing<\/h3>\n<p>The above strategies address different content marketing types, from social media posts to email newsletters and website content. Creating high-quality content across these platforms is essential if you want internet marketing success. If the thought of creating content for all these different online marketing portals is daunting, don&#8217;t stress: You can &#8220;cross-pollinate&#8221; by adapting content to various formats.<\/p>\n<p>For example, say a client leaves a glowing review, saying your HVAC company is one of their favorite local businesses. You can incorporate this review into your website, email campaigns, and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.highervisibility.com\/social-media-marketing\/\">social media<\/a>. Similarly, if you send out an email campaign touting your local services holiday special, this can also be shared on your website and social channels. When you create content in one place, it can also be used elsewhere.<\/p>\n<h3>10. Analyze Your HVAC Marketing Success<\/h3>\n<p>One of the great things about digital marketing endeavors like social media and email marketing is that you can easily measure your marketing efforts&#8217; success. For example, email analytics tools allow you to see who has opened a message and what links they clicked on. Web analytics tools will enable you to see which pages people visit your website are spending time on and how much time they are spending on a page.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some popular analytics tools to get you started:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Heap Analytics: This tool tracks all actions taken by your website visitors.<\/li>\n<li>Google search console: This tool lets you analyze organic search traffic to see how your SEO efforts are doing.<\/li>\n<li>Cyfe: An all-in-one dashboard, you can track social media platforms, pay-per-click marketing efforts, and more in one place.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Social media analytics is quickly done by checking aspects like shares and likes. Pay attention to your analytics to determine what is and isn&#8217;t working in your HVAC marketing strategy. This is valuable information, allowing you to perfect your marketing strategy so that it&#8217;s more likely to win customer trust, interest, and loyalty.<\/p>\n<p>Say you posted a series of video tutorials on what to do when your air conditioner makes certain noises, e.g., clanging versus banging versus rattling. These videos proved to be super popular. They got a lot of views on YouTube and shares on social media. You can go ahead and make more content towards this end to keep your customers engaged.<\/p>\n<h2>The Final Word on HVAC Business Marketing Strategies<\/h2>\n<p>If you are starting to look into HVAC marketing strategies, implementing all of the above tips may seem daunting. Don&#8217;t stress. You don&#8217;t have to tackle it all once.<\/p>\n<p>Prioritize your website because that&#8217;s how people find you online and get valuable info about your business. Hire a web designer if you need help. You can then tackle low-cost measures, like social media. Save pricier items, like investing in analytics tech, for later.<\/p>\n<p>Be patient and take it step-by-step. Soon enough, you will quickly have a comprehensive marketing strategy to support your business success. In today&#8217;s competitive HVAC industry, you can&#8217;t ignore the value of marketing. You will see a return on investment when your small business grows and your bottom line increases.<\/p>\n<div class='incontent-cta'><h3>Most HVAC Businesses Struggle with Generating Leads...We Fix That!<\/h3><p><p>Since 2009, we have helped many HVAC businesses grow strategically.
